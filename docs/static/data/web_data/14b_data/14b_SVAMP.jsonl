The problem is about birds migrating to different countries. There are 41 bird families near the mountain. Wait, wait, no, wait. Wait, the first sentence says there are 41 bird families living near the mountain. Then, 35 flew to Asia and 62 flew to Africa. The question is asking how many more bird families flew to Africa than to Asia. Hmm, so I need to find the difference between the number that went to Africa and the number that went to Asia.\n\nLet me break it down. The number that went to Africa is 62, and the number that went to Asia is 35. So the difference would be 62 minus 35. Let me do that calculation. 62 minus 30 is 32, and then minus 5 more is 27. So the difference is 27. Wait, that seems right. Let me check again. 62 - 35. Yeah, 35 plus 27 is 62. So yes, 27 is the correct answer.

Let me read again. The question asks how many more flew to Africa than to Asia. So I don't need the total number of families near the mountain to find the difference between the two numbers. Right, because the question is just about the difference between the numbers that went to each place.\n\nSo, the number that flew to Asia is 35, and the number that flew to Africa is 62. The question is asking for the difference between these two numbers. So I need to subtract the number that went to Asia from the number that went to Africa. Let me write that down:\n\n62 (Africa) - 35 (Asia) = ?\n\nLet me do the subtraction. 62 minus 35. Hmm, 62 minus 30 is 32, and then minus 5 more is 27. So the result is 27. So 62 minus 35 equals 27.

So Marco's original amount plus dad's original amount equals 22. Let me call Marco's original amount M and dad's original amount D. So M + D = 22.\n\nThen, dad found 30 more pounds. So dad's total now is D + 30. Marco's amount stayed the same, right? Because the problem says \"Marco's strawberries now weighed 36 pounds.\" Wait, but originally the total was 22. So if Marco's original was M, and now it's 36, that means M must have been 36 pounds? But that can't be, because M + D = 22. If M was 36, then D would be -14, which doesn't make sense. Oh, wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, the problem says \"Marco's strawberries now weighed 36 pounds.\" So maybe Marco's strawberries didn't change? Wait, no, that can't be.

Let me read the problem again.\n\n\"Marco and his dad went strawberry picking. Together they collected strawberries that weighed 22 pounds. On the way back Marco's dad found 30 more pounds of strawberries. Marco's strawberries now weighed 36 pounds.

Wait, the problem says \"Marco's strawberries now weighed 36 pounds.\" So that must be his original amount plus whatever he found? No, the problem says they collected together 22 pounds. So maybe the 36 is after some addition? But the problem states that on the way back, dad found 30 more pounds. So the total now is 22 +30 =52 pounds.

Wait, wait, maybe I misunderstood.\n\nWait, the problem says: Together they collected strawberries that weighed 22 pounds. So the total they picked together was 22 pounds. Then on the way back, Marco's dad found 30 more pounds. So dad's total now is his original amount plus 30. Marco's strawberries now weigh 36 pounds. So Marco's original amount must be 36 pounds? Because the problem says \"Marco's strawberries now weighed 36 pounds.\" So that means Marco's amount hasn't changed. So his original amount was 36 pounds. Then the total they collected together was 22 pounds. So if Marco had 36 originally, that would mean D = 22 - M. But M is 36, so D would be 22 - 36 = -14. That can't be. So that's not possible. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, let me read again. \"Together they collected strawberries that weighed 22 pounds.\" So the total they picked together was 22 pounds. Then on the way back, Marco's dad found 30 more pounds. So dad's total now is D + 30. Marco's strawberries now weigh 36 pounds. So Marco's original amount must be 36 pounds? Because the problem says \"Marco's strawberries now weighed 36 pounds.\" So that implies that Marco's amount hasn't changed. So if the total they collected together was 22 pounds, and Marco had 36 originally, that's impossible. So there's a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the 36 pounds is after the dad found the 30 pounds. Let me think again.\n\nLet me set up equations. Let M be Marco's original amount, D be dad's original amount. So M + D = 22. Then, dad found 30 more pounds, so dad's total now is D + 30. Marco's total is still M. But the problem states that Marco's strawberries now weigh 36 pounds. So M = 36. But if M is 36, then D would be 22 - 36 = -14, which is impossible. So that can't be. So maybe the problem is that the 36 pounds is after some other change. Wait, maybe I misread the problem.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"Marco and his dad went strawberry picking. Together they collected strawberries that weighed 22 pounds. On the way back Marco's dad found 30 more pounds of strawberries. Marco's strawberries now weighed 36 pounds. How much did his dad's strawberries weigh now?\"\n\nAh, maybe the 36 pounds is after the dad found the 30 pounds. Wait, no. The problem says \"Marco's strawberries now weighed 36 pounds.\" So that's after the dad found the 30 pounds. So the dad's total is D + 30, and Marco's is M. But the total they collected together was 22 pounds. So M + D = 22. But now Marco has 36 pounds. So that implies that M must have been 36 pounds. But that would mean D is 22 - 36 = -14, which is impossible. So there's a contradiction here. So perhaps the problem is phrased incorrectly. Let me read again.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the total they collected was 22 pounds, but then Marco's dad found 30 more. So the total now is 22 + 30 = 52 pounds. But Marco's strawberries are 36, so dad's would be 52 - 36 = 16. But that would make sense. Let me check that.\n\nTotal original: 22 pounds. Dad found 30 more, so total now is 22 + 30 = 52. Marco's strawberries are 36, so dad's are 52 - 36 = 16. That works. So the answer would be 16. But let me verify.\n\nOriginal total: 22. Let's say Marco had M and dad had D. M + D =22. After dad found 30, total is 52. Marco's is 36, so dad's is 52 -36=16. So D +30=16 => D= -14. But that's impossible. Wait, that's a problem. So this approach leads to D being negative, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps the problem is that Marco's strawberries now weigh 36, which is after the dad found the 30 pounds. So the total now is 52, and Marco's is 36, so dad's is 16. But if D was originally part of the 22, then D would have to be 16 -30 = -14, which is impossible. So perhaps the problem is that the 36 pounds is not Marco's original amount. Wait, maybe the problem says that after the dad found 30 pounds, Marco's strawberries now weigh 36. So that would mean that Marco's original amount plus the dad's original amount is 22. Then, the dad found 30, so dad's total is D +30. Marco's total is M. But the problem states that Marco's strawberries now weigh 36. So M =36. But M + D =22. So D=22-36= -14. Which is impossible. So perhaps the problem is that the 36 pounds is the total after the dad found the 30. So total now is 22 +30=52. Marco's is 36, so dad's is 16. So the answer is 16. But that would mean that the original amounts were M=36 and D= -14, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps the problem is that the 36 pounds is the total after the dad found the 30. So the answer is 16. But the original setup is impossible. So maybe the problem has a mistake. But according to the problem statement, the answer would be 16.\n</LONG_COT>\n<ANSWER>\n16\n</ANSWER>", "answer": "16", "is_correct": true, "token_count": 1578}}

Each row has 24 pencils, 30 rows. 24*30. Another way: 30*20=600, and 30*4=120. 600+120=720. Yep, that's the same answer. So I think that's correct.

The problem says that Ed had 10 more marbles than Doug. Then Doug lost 11 marbles at the playground. Now, Ed has 45 marbles. I need to find out how many more marbles Ed has than Doug now.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many marbles Doug had originally. Since Ed had 10 more than Doug, if Ed has 45 now, Doug must have had 45 minus 10 originally. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Let me assign variables. Let's say Doug originally had D marbles. Then Ed had D + 10 marbles. But wait, the problem says \"Ed had 10 more marbles than Doug.\" So yes, Ed's original amount is D + 10. But the problem also states that Ed currently has 45 marbles. Wait, wait, the problem says \"If Ed had 45 marbles.\" So that's the current situation? Wait, no. Let me read again.\n\n\"The problem says: Ed had 10 more marbles than Doug. Doug lost 11 of his marbles at the playground. If Ed had 45 marbles How many more marbles did Ed have than Doug then?\"\n\nOh, wait, the wording is a bit confusing. Let me parse it again. The first sentence: \"Ed had 10 more marbles than Doug.\" So originally, Ed's marbles = Doug's marbles + 10. Then, Doug lost 11 marbles. So Doug's current marbles are original minus 11. Then, the question is, how many more marbles does Ed have than Doug now. But the problem says \"If Ed had 45 marbles\". Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me check the exact wording again.\n\n\"The problem says: Ed had 10 more marbles than Doug. Doug lost 11 of his marbles at the playground. If Ed had 45 marbles How many more marbles did Ed have than Doug then?\"\n\nWait, the structure is a bit unclear. Let me break it down. The first part: \"Ed had 10 more marbles than Doug.\" So originally, Ed's marbles = Doug's marbles + 10. Then, Doug lost 11 marbles. So Doug's current marbles are original minus 11. Then, the question is, how many more marbles does Ed have than Doug now. But the problem says \"If Ed had 45 marbles\". So maybe the problem is saying that currently, Ed has 45 marbles. So the \"if\" part is just a condition. So the setup is:\n\nOriginally, Ed had 10 more marbles than Doug. Then Doug lost 11 marbles. Now, Ed has 45 marbles. How many more marbles does Ed have than Doug now.\n\nSo let's set up variables. Let D be the number of marbles Doug originally had. Then Ed originally had D + 10. Now, Doug lost 11 marbles, so Doug now has D - 11 marbles. Ed still has 45 marbles. The question is, how many more marbles does Ed have than Doug now. So the difference is 45 - (D - 11) = 45 - D + 11 = 56 - D. But we need to find D first. Wait, but how do we find D? The problem states that Ed currently has 45 marbles. So Ed's current marbles are 45, which is the same as his original amount. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says \"If Ed had 45 marbles\". So that's the current situation. So Ed's current marbles are 45. So his original marbles were 45. Because the problem says \"If Ed had 45 marbles\". So that's the current number. So Ed's original marbles were 45. Then, originally, Doug had 45 - 10 = 35 marbles. Then Doug lost 11, so now he has 35 - 11 = 24 marbles. So Ed has 45, Doug has 24. So the difference is 45 - 24 = 21.

The problem is about calculating the total number of oranges harvested after 87 days. The information given is that they harvest 66 sacks per day, and each sack contains 25 oranges. Hmm, so I need to find the total number of oranges.\n\nFirst, I should break this down into smaller steps. Maybe start by finding out how many oranges are in one day's harvest. Since each day they harvest 66 sacks, and each sack has 25 oranges, I can multiply those two numbers. So, 66 sacks/day * 25 oranges/sack. Let me do that calculation. 66 times 25. Let's see, 60 times 25 is 1500, and 6 times 25 is 150. So 1500 + 150 = 1650. So that's 1650 oranges per day.\n\nNow, if they harvest 1650 oranges each day, then over 87 days, I need to multiply that by 87. So 1650 * 87. Hmm, that's a bigger multiplication. Let me think. Maybe break it down. 1650 * 80 is 132,000. And 1650 * 7 is 11,550. So adding those together: 132,000 + 11,550 = 143,550. So the total number of oranges after 87 days would be 143,550. Let me double-check that. Alternative approach: 87 * 66 * 25. Let's compute 87 *66 first. 80*66=5280, 7*66=462. So 5280+462=5742. Then 5742 *25. 5000*25=125,000. 700*25=17,500. 42*25=1,050. So 125,000 +17,500=142,500 +1,050=143,550. Yep, same result. So that's correct.

The problem is about calculating the total number of oranges harvested after 87 days. The information given is that they harvest 66 sacks per day, and each sack contains 25 oranges. Hmm, so I need to find the total oranges.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many sacks they harvest in a day. That's 66 sacks per day. Then, each sack has 25 oranges. So maybe I need to multiply the number of sacks per day by the number of oranges per sack to get the daily total. Let me check that. Yes, that makes sense. So per day, it's 66 sacks * 25 oranges/sack. Let me compute that. 66 times 25. Hmm, 60 times 25 is 1500, and 6 times 25 is 150. So 1500 + 150 = 1650. So each day they harvest 1650 oranges.\n\nNow, the question is about 87 days of harvest. So I need to multiply the daily total by the number of days. So 1650 oranges/day * 87 days. Let me do that calculation. Maybe break it down to make it easier. 1650 * 80 is 132,000. And 1650 * 7 is 11,550. So adding those together: 132,000 + 11,550 = 143,550. So the total number of oranges after 87 days would be 143,550. Let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe there's another way to calculate it. Instead of multiplying 66 *25 first, I could multiply 66 *87 first and then multiply by 25. Let's try that. 66 *87. 60*87=5220, 6*87=522. So 5220+522=5742. Then 5742 *25. 5000*25=125,000. 700*25=17,500. 42*25=1,050. So 125,000 +17,500=142,500 +1,050=143,550. Same result. So that confirms it.

The problem is about Bryan's books and magazines. He has 9 books and 46 magazines on each of his 10 bookshelves. The question is asking how many magazines he has in total. Hmm, I need to find the total number of magazines.\n\nFirst, I should make sure I understand the problem correctly. Each bookshelf has 9 books and 46 magazines. There are 10 bookshelves. So for each shelf, the number of magazines is 46. Since there are 10 shelves, I need to multiply the number of magazines per shelf by the number of shelves. That should give the total number of magazines.\n\nLet me break it down step by step. Each shelf has 46 magazines. So one shelf contributes 46 magazines. If there are 10 shelves, then 46 multiplied by 10. Let me do that calculation. 46 times 10 is 460. So the total number of magazines should be 460. Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nAlternative approach: Total items per shelf is 9 books + 46 magazines = 55 items. But the question only asks about magazines. So the total magazines are 46 per shelf times 10 shelves. Yeah, that's correct. So 46 * 10 = 460. That makes sense. I don't think I made a mistake here.

Then he added 89 new ones. So the total after adding would be 21 + 89. Let me calculate that. 21 plus 80 is 101, and then plus 9 is 110. So he had 110 apps after adding. Then he deleted some, and ended up with 24. So the question is, how many more apps did he add than he deleted?\n\nWait, the question asks how many more apps he added than he deleted. So I need to find the difference between the number of apps he added and the number he deleted. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the number of apps added is 89. The number of apps deleted would be the total after adding minus the final amount. So he had 110 after adding and then 24 left. So the number deleted is 110 - 24.

The problem is about comparing the number of kids who went to camp and those who stayed home during summer break in Lawrence county. The numbers given are 202,958 kids went to camp, and 777,622 stayed home. The question is asking how many more kids stayed home compared to those who went to the camp. Hmm, so I need to find the difference between the two numbers.\n\nFirst, I should make sure I understand the numbers correctly. The kids who went to camp are 202,958. The kids who stayed home are 777,622. The question is asking for the difference, so I need to subtract the smaller number from the larger one. That makes sense. So the calculation would be 777,622 minus 202,958.\n\nLet me write that down to make it clearer. So, 777,622 - 202,958. Let me do this step by step. Maybe I can break it down into smaller parts to avoid mistakes.\n\nFirst, let's align the numbers by their digits:\n\n777,622\n-202,958\n_________\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit. The units place: 2 - 8. Oh, that's a problem. I can't subtract 8 from 2. So I need to borrow from the tens place. The tens place is 2 (from 622), so borrow 1, making it 12. Then 12 - 8 = 4. So the units digit is 4.\n\nNext, the tens place: originally it was 2 (after borrowing, it's 1). So 1 - 5. Again, can't do that. So borrow from the hundreds place. The hundreds place is 6 (from 622), so borrow 1, making it 5. Then 11 - 5 = 6. So the tens digit is 6.\n\nNow the hundreds place: originally 6, after borrowing it's 5. So 5 - 9. Can't do that. So borrow from the thousands place. The thousands place is 7 (from 777,622), so borrow 1, making it 6. Then 15 - 9 = 6. So the hundreds digit is 6.\n\nThousands place: originally 7, after borrowing it's 6. So 6 - 2 = 4. So the thousands digit is 4.\n\nTen thousands place: 7 - 0 = 7. So the ten thousands digit is 7.\n\nHundred thousands place: 7 - 2 = 5. So the hundred thousands digit is 5.\n\nPutting it all together: 574,664. So the difference is 574,664. Let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe there's a easier way. Let me add the two numbers and see if that matches.\n\nWait, maybe another approach. Let's see. 777,622 - 202,958. Alternatively, 777,622 is the larger number. So subtracting 202,958 from it. Let me do the subtraction again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using mental math. Let's approximate. 777,622 is approximately 777,600. 202,958 is approximately 203,000. So 777,600 - 203,000 = 574,600. The actual numbers are a bit different, so the exact difference would be slightly more. Let me check the exact calculation.\n\nAlternatively, using calculator steps. But since I'm doing this manually, let's proceed step by step.\n\nSo:\n\n777,622\n-202,958\n_________\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n2 - 8: borrow 1 from the tens place. So 12 - 8 = 4. Tens place becomes 1 (from 2) after borrowing.\n\n1 - 5: borrow 1 from the hundreds place. So 11 - 5 = 6. Hundreds place becomes 5 (from 6) after borrowing.\n\n5 - 9: borrow 1 from the thousands place. So 15 - 9 = 6. Thousands place becomes 6 (from 7) after borrowing.\n\n6 - 2 = 4. So thousands place is 4.\n\n7 - 0 = 7. So ten thousands place is 7.\n\n7 - 2 = 5. So hundred thousands place is 5.\n\nSo the result is 574,664. That seems correct. So the answer should be 574,664.\n</LONG_COT>\n<ANSWER>\n574664\n</ANSWER>", "answer": "574664", "is_correct": true, "token_count": 1074}}

The first sentence says the grasshopper jumped 13 inches. Then the second sentence says the grasshopper jumped 2 inches farther than the grasshopper. That can't be. That must be a typo.

The original problem says \"The grasshopper jumped 2 inches farther than the grasshopper.\" That's impossible. So there must be a mistake in the problem statement. Perhaps it's a typo, and the intended statement is that the frog jumped 2 inches farther than the grasshopper. So the correct interpretation is that the frog's jump is 13 + 2 = 15 inches.

The problem is about a baker who made some cakes, sold some, and then made more. I need to find out how many more cakes he made than those he sold.

Let me check the numbers again.\n\nHe initially made 144 cakes. Then he sold 71. So the total cakes made is 144 + 111. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says he made 144 cakes, sold 71, then made 111 more. So the total cakes made is 144 + 111. The number sold is 71. So the question is asking for (144 + 111) - 71. Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, 144 + 111. Let's add them. 144 + 100 is 244, then +11 is 255. So total cakes made is 255. He sold 71. So 255 - 71 = 184. So the answer should be 184. Let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I misunderstood the question. Let me read again.\n\nThe question says: \"How many more cakes did baker make than those he sold?\" So total cakes made minus cakes sold. So yes, that's 255 - 71 = 184. That makes sense. So the answer is 184.\n</LONG_COT>\n<ANSWER>\n184\n</ANSWER>", "answer": "184", "is_correct": true, "token_count": 494}}

The problem says that Lawrence county has 313,473 kids in total. During the summer break, 274,865 kids stay home, and the rest go to camp. I need to find out how many kids go to the camp. Hmm, right.\n\nSo the total number of kids is 313,473. If 274,865 are staying home, then the number who go to camp should be the total minus those who stay home. That makes sense. Let me write that down.\n\nTotal kids = 313,473\nKids staying home = 274,865\nKids going to camp = Total kids - Kids staying home\n\nSo I need to subtract 274,865 from 313,473. Let me do that step by step. Maybe I should line them up vertically to make it easier.\n\n313,473\n-274,865\n------------\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n3 (thousandths place) minus 5. Wait, that's a problem. Oh, I need to borrow. Let me think. Let's do it properly.\n\nFirst, align the numbers:\n\n  313473\n- 274865\n-----------\n\nStarting from the units place:\n3 - 5. Can't do that, so borrow 1 from the tens place. The tens place is 7. Borrow 1, so it becomes 6. The units place becomes 13. 13 - 5 = 8.\n\nNow the tens place: 6 - 6 = 0.\n\nHundreds place: 4 - 8. Again, can't do that. So borrow 1 from the thousands place. The thousands place is 3. Borrow 1, so it becomes 2. The hundreds place becomes 14. 14 - 8 = 6.\n\nThousands place: 2 - 4. Can't do that. So borrow 1 from the ten-thousands place. The ten-thousands place is 1. Borrow 1, so it becomes 0. The thousands place becomes 12. 12 - 4 = 8.\n\nTen-thousands place: 0 - 7. Can't do that. So borrow 1 from the hundred-thousands place. The hundred-thousands place is 3. Borrow 1, so it becomes 2. The ten-thousands place becomes 10. 10 - 7 = 3.\n\nHundred-thousands place: 2 - 2 = 0.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n  313473\n- 274865\n----------\n   38608\n\nWait, let me check that again. Let me add 274,865 and 38,608 to see if it equals 313,473.\n\n274,865 + 38,608 = let's add:\n\n274,865\n+ 38,608\n----------\nFirst, 5 + 8 = 13. Carry 1.\n6 + 0 + 1 = 7.\n8 + 6 = 14.

So 3 becomes 2, and the hundreds becomes 14. 14-8=6. \n\nThousands place: 2 -4. Can't do that. So borrow 1 from the ten thousands place. The ten thousands place is 1 (since 313,473 is 3 hundred thousands, 1 ten thousand, 3 thousands, etc.). So 1 becomes 0, and the thousands becomes 12. 12-4=8. \n\nTen thousands place: 0 -7. Can't do that. So borrow 1 from the hundred thousands place. The hundred thousands place is 3. So 3 becomes 2, and the ten thousands becomes 10. 10-7=3. \n\nHundred thousands place: 2 -2=0. \n\nSo the result is 38,608. Let me check that. \n\nWait, let's add 274,865 + 38,608. \n\n274,865 + 38,608 = 313,473. Yes, that's correct.

How much did they jump altogether?", "data_source": "my_data/SVAMP", "ground_truth": "66", "adaptive": {"response": "<LONG_COT>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about a grasshopper and a frog having a jumping contest. The grasshopper jumped 35 inches, and I know that the grasshopper jumped 4 inches farther than the frog. I need to find out how much they jumped altogether. Hmm, okay, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the grasshopper's jump is 35 inches. The problem says the grasshopper jumped 4 inches farther than the frog. So that means the frog's jump must be less than the grasshopper's. Let me think. If the grasshopper jumped 4 inches more, then the frog's distance would be the grasshopper's distance minus 4 inches. So the frog's jump is 35 inches minus 4 inches. Let me calculate that. 35 minus 4 is 31. So the frog jumped 31 inches.\n\nNow, the total distance they jumped altogether is the sum of the grasshopper's jump and the frog's jump. So that would be 35 inches plus 31 inches. Let me add those. 35 + 31. Let's see, 30 + 30 is 60, and 5 + 1 is 6. So 60 + 6 = 66. So the total is 66 inches.\n\nWait, let me double-check. If the frog jumped 31 inches, and the grasshopper jumped 4 inches more, then 31 +4 = 35. That matches the given information. So that's correct. Then adding 35 and 31 gives 66. Yep, that seems right.

So maybe I should subtract 4 from 35 to find the frog's distance. Let me check that. If the grasshopper jumped 4 inches more, then subtracting 4 should give the frog's distance. So 35 minus 4 equals 31. So the frog jumped 31 inches. \n\nNow, to find the total distance they both jumped, I need to add the grasshopper's jump and the frog's jump. So 35 plus 31. Let me add those. 35 + 31 is 66. So together, they jumped 66 inches. That makes sense. Let me double-check.

So the question is 14 minus 13. That should be 1. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me read the problem again.\n\nPaco had 17 cookies. He ate 14 cookies and gave 13 of them to his friend. How many more cookies did he eat than those he gave to his friend? Oh wait, wait a second. Wait, wait. Wait, the total he had was 17. He ate 14 and gave 13 to his friend. But wait, that doesn't add up. Because 14 +13 is 27, but he only had 17. That can't be. So there's a mistake here. Wait, that's a problem. That means the numbers don't make sense. Let me read the problem again.\n\nOh, wait, maybe I misunderstood. Let me read again. \"He ate 14 cookies and gave 13 of them to his friend.\" Wait, that's confusing. Wait, perhaps the problem says he ate 14 cookies and gave 13 cookies to his friend. But how is that possible if he only had 17? Because 14 +13 =27, which is more than 17. So that's impossible. So there must be a mistake in the problem. But the problem as stated says he ate 14 and gave 13. So maybe the problem has a mistake, but I need to proceed with the given numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misunderstood. Let me read again. \"He ate 14 cookies and gave 13 of them to his friend.\" Wait, perhaps \"of them\" refers to the cookies he ate. So he ate 14, and then gave 13 of those 14 to his friend. But that would mean he ate 14 and gave 13 away, so he kept 1. But that would make sense. But the problem says he had 17 cookies. So if he started with 17, ate 14, then gave 13 of the eaten cookies to his friend. But that would mean he gave away more than he ate, which doesn't make sense. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is phrased incorrectly. Let me try another approach. Let's assume the problem is correct as stated. So he ate 14 cookies and gave 13 cookies to his friend. But how is that possible if he only had 17? That would require him to have more than 17 cookies initially, which contradicts the problem statement. So perhaps the problem has a mistake. But since the problem says he had 17, ate 14, and gave 13, that's impossible. So perhaps the problem is incorrect. But maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem says he ate 14 and gave 13 to his friend, but perhaps the 13 is a different number. Let me check again. The problem says: \"He ate 14 cookies and gave 13 of them to his friend.\" So perhaps \"them\" refers to the cookies he had. So he ate 14, and then gave 13 of the remaining cookies to his friend. But that would require him to have at least 14 +13 =27 cookies, which is impossible. So that's not possible. So perhaps the problem is incorrect. But maybe the question is correct, and I need to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is correct, and I need to find the difference between the number he ate and the number he gave. So 14 minus 13 is 1. So the answer would be 1. But that would only be correct if the numbers add up. But the numbers don't add up. So perhaps the problem has a mistake.

Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is phrased incorrectly. Like, maybe she gained 101 kg instead of losing. But that wouldn't make sense either. Because if she gained, her current weight would be higher than the original. But the problem says she lost. So maybe the numbers are correct, and the answer is 128. But that's a huge weight loss. Maybe the units are wrong. Like, maybe it's 101 pounds instead of kilograms. But the problem states kilograms. So I have to go with the numbers given. So the answer would be 27 + 101 = 128 kg. That's the only logical conclusion here.\n</LONG_COT>\n<ANSWER>\n128\n</ANSWER>", "answer": "128", "is_correct": true, "token_count": 374}}

So maybe I should subtract 49 from David's total to get Zachary's. Let me check that. If Zachary did, say, x push-ups, then David did x + 49. And we know David did 51. So x + 49 = 51. Solving for x, I subtract 49 from both sides: x = 51 - 49. That gives x = 2. So Zachary did 2 push-ups. Then together, David and Zachary did 51 + 2 = 53. Wait, that seems right. Let me think again.

The problem is about a school with boys and girls. They want to know how many more girls than boys there are after some new girls joined. Hmm, let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the initial numbers. There are 362 boys and 257 girls. Then, 403 more girls joined. So I need to find the new total number of girls and compare it to the number of boys.\n\nWait, the question is asking \"how many more girls than boys does the school have?\" So the answer should be the difference between the total number of girls and the total number of boys. Right.\n\nLet me start with the boys. The number of boys is given as 362. That stays the same because no new boys are mentioned. So the boys count is fixed at 362.\n\nNow the girls. Initially, there are 257 girls. Then 403 more girls joined. So I need to add those two numbers. Let me do that calculation. 257 plus 403. Let's see, 257 + 400 is 657, and then plus 3 is 660. So the total number of girls now is 660.\n\nNow, the question is how many more girls than boys. So subtract the number of boys from the number of girls. That would be 660 (girls) minus 362 (boys). Let me compute that. 660 - 362. Hmm, 660 minus 300 is 360, then minus 62 is 298. So the difference is 298.\n\nWait, let me check that again. 660 - 362. Alternatively, 362 + 298 = 660.

She picked 8 from each, so from each tree, the number of apples left would be the initial amount minus 8. Since there are 3 trees, the total apples left now are 9. So maybe I can set up an equation.\n\nLet me think. Let's say each tree initially had x apples. Then after picking 8 from each, each tree has x - 8 apples left. Since there are 3 trees, the total left is 3*(x - 8) = 9. So the equation would be 3(x - 8) = 9. Let me solve that.\n\nDivide both sides by 3: x - 8 = 3. Then add 8 to both sides: x = 11. So each tree initially had 11 apples. That means total initially was 3*11 = 33 apples. Let me check. If each had 11, she picked 8 from each, so 8*3 = 24 picked. 33 -24 =9 left. Yep, that matches.

The question is asking how many more Ace cards than baseball cards she has now. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how many cards she gave away for each type. Let's start with the baseball cards. She originally had 246, and now she has 404. Wait, wait, that doesn't make sense. If she gave some away, the number should decrease, right?

The problem is about Frank reading a book. The book has 2 chapters, each with 405 pages. He took 664 days to finish the book. The question is asking how many chapters he read per day. Hmm, I need to find the number of chapters he read each day on average.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the total number of chapters in the book. The book has 2 chapters. So that's straightforward. Each chapter has 405 pages, but wait, the pages might be a distraction here. The question is about chapters per day, so the page count might not be directly relevant. Let me check. Oh, right, the problem asks for chapters per day, so the total number of chapters is 2. So the total chapters are 2. He took 664 days to finish. So the calculation would be total chapters divided by total days. That gives the average number of chapters per day.\n\nSo the formula would be: chapters per day = total chapters / total days. Plugging in the numbers: 2 chapters divided by 664 days. Let me do that division. 2 divided by 664. That equals 0.003012... approximately. But wait, the question might expect a fractional answer or a decimal. Let me think. The problem says \"how many chapters did he read per day?\" So the answer is a fraction or a decimal. Let me compute it exactly. 2/664 simplifies. Both numbers are even, so divide numerator and denominator by 2. That gives 1/332. So 1/332 is approximately 0.003012. So the exact answer is 1/332 chapters per day. But the problem might want it in a simpler form. Let me check if that's correct.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Total chapters: 2. Total days: 664. So 2/664 = 1/332. Yes, that's correct. So the answer is 1/332 chapters per day. That's the exact value.

Paul started with a box of crayons for his birthday. By the end of the school year, he lost or gave away 551 of them and had 177 left. I need to find out how many crayons he originally had.\n\nHmm, so the problem is about finding the initial number of crayons. Let me think. If he lost or gave away 551 crayons and was left with 177, then the original number must be the sum of the crayons he lost and the ones he has left.

I need to find out how many crayons he originally had.\n\nHmm, so the problem is about finding the initial number of crayons. Let me think. If he lost or gave away 551, that means he subtracted 551 from the original amount. And what's left is 177. So the original number minus 551 equals 177. That sounds right.\n\nLet me write that as an equation. Let's say the original number is X. Then X - 551 = 177. To find X, I need to add 551 to both sides. So X = 177 + 551. Let me do that addition. 177 plus 500 is 677, and then plus 51 is 728. So X = 728. Wait, that seems straightforward.

The problem is about calculating how many buses are needed for a field trip. The school has 67 classrooms, each with 66 students. Each bus has 6 seats. I need to find out how many buses are required.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the total number of students. Since there are 67 classrooms and each has 66 students, I need to multiply those two numbers. So, 67 times 66. Let me do that calculation. 67 * 60 is 4020, and 67 * 6 is 402. So adding them together, 4020 + 402 = 4422. So there are 4422 students in total.\n\nNow, each bus has 6 seats. So I need to divide the total number of students by the number of seats per bus. That would be 4422 divided by 6. Let me do that division. 6 goes into 4422. Let's see, 6 * 700 = 4200. Subtract that from 4422: 4422 - 4200 = 222. Now, 6 goes into 222 exactly 37 times because 6*37=222. So 700 + 37 = 737. So that's 737 buses. But wait, wait a second. Wait, no. Wait, 6 * 737 = 4422. Yeah, that's correct.

The problem says that during summer break, 61619 kids from Lawrence county stayed home, and the rest went to camp. The total number of kids in the county is 91676. I need to find out how many went to camp. Hmm, right.\n\nSo the total number of kids is 91676. If 61619 stayed home, then the number that went to camp would be the total minus those who stayed home. That makes sense. So I should subtract 61619 from 91676. Let me check that again. Yeah, because the total is the sum of those who stayed home and those who went to camp. So subtracting the stayed home number from the total gives the campers.\n\nLet me do the subtraction. Let's write it out:\n\n91676 - 61619. Okay, let's subtract the numbers. Starting from the units place. 6 (from 91676) minus 9 (from 61619). Wait, that's not possible. So I need to borrow. Let's see. The tens place in 91676 is 7, so borrow 1 from the hundreds place. Wait, maybe easier to do it step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to subtract each digit. Let's align the numbers:\n\n  91676\n-61619\n________\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n6 (units) - 9. Can't do, so borrow 1 from the tens place. The tens place is 7. Borrow 1, so it becomes 6. The units becomes 16. 16-9=7.\n\nNow the tens place: 6 (after borrowing) -1 =5. Wait, wait no. Let me think again. Wait, the original numbers are 91676 and 61619. Let's write them with commas for clarity:\n\n91,676\n61,619\n\nSubtracting:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n6 (units) -9. Can't do. So borrow 1 from the tens place. Tens place is 7. Borrow 1, so it's 6. Units becomes 16. 16-9=7.\n\nTens place: 7 (after borrowing) -1 =6. Wait, no. Let me check again. The original tens digit in 91676 is 6. After borrowing 1, it becomes 5. So:\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me do it properly.\n\nLet's subtract 61619 from 91676.\n\nFirst, align the numbers:\n\n  91676\n- 61619\n________\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n6 -9.

So tens digit is 6.\n\nHundreds place: 6 -6 =0.\n\nThousands place: 1 -1 =0.\n\nTen-thousands place: 9 -6 =3.\n\nSo the result is 30057. Let me check that. 61619 + 30057 = 91676. Let's add:\n\n61619 + 30057:\n\n61619 + 30000 = 91619.\n\n91619 +57 = 91676. Yes, that's correct.

The problem is about finding out how many kids went to camp during summer break. The total number of kids in Lawrence county is 91,676. Out of these, 61,619 stayed home. The rest went to camp. So I need to subtract the number of kids who stayed home from the total number to find out how many went to camp.\n\nWait, let me make sure I understand. Total kids = 91,676. Kids who stayed home = 61,619. So the ones who went to camp would be total minus stayed home. That makes sense. So the calculation is 91,676 minus 61,619. Let me do that subtraction.\n\nHmm, let's subtract the numbers. Maybe I should align them by digits. So:\n\n91,676\n-61,619\n________\n\nStarting from the right. The units place: 6 - 9. Oh, that's not possible. So I need to borrow. The tens place is 7. So borrow 1 from the hundreds place. But wait, the hundreds place is 6. So borrow 1 from the thousands place. Let me think again. Let's do it step by step.\n\nStarting from the right:\n\nUnits place: 6 - 9. Can't do. So borrow 1 from the tens place. But the tens place is 7. So 7 becomes 6, and the units place becomes 16. 16 - 9 = 7.\n\nTens place: Now it's 6 (after borrowing). 6 - 1 = 5. Wait, wait no. Wait, the original number is 91,676. So the digits are 9 (hundred-thousands), 1 (ten-thousands), 6 (thousands), 7 (hundreds), 6 (tens), 6 (units). Wait, wait no. Let me write it out correctly.\n\nTotal: 91,676. So that's:\n\n9 (hundred-thousands place)\n1 (ten-thousands place)\n6 (thousands place)\n7 (hundreds place)\n6 (tens place)\n6 (units place)\n\nSubtracting 61,619:\n\n61,619 is:\n\n6 (ten-thousands place)\n1 (thousands place)\n6 (hundreds place)\n1 (tens place)\n9 (units place)\n\nSo let's subtract:\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n6 (units) - 9. Can't do. So borrow 1 from tens. Tens is 6. So 6 becomes 5, units becomes 16. 16-9=7.\n\nTens place: 5 (after borrowing) -1 =4.\n\nHundreds place: 7 -6=1.\n\nThousands place: 6 -1=5.\n\nTen-thousands place: 1 -6. Wait, that's a problem. Because 1 (ten-thousands) -6. That's not possible. So I need to borrow from the hundred-thousands place. The hundred-thousands place is 9. So borrow 1, making it 8. Then the ten-thousands place becomes 11. 11 -6=5.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n8 (hundred-thousands)\n5 (ten-thousands)\n5 (thousands)\n1 (hundreds)\n4 (tens)\n7 (units)\n\nSo the result is 85,547. Wait, let me check that again. Let me do the subtraction again more carefully.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a simpler way. Let's subtract the numbers directly.\n\n91,676 - 61,619.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n91,676 - 60,000 = 31,676.\n\nThen subtract 1,619 from 31,676.\n\n31,676 - 1,619 = 30,057.\n\nWait, that's another approach. Let's see. 91,676 minus 60,000 is 31,676. Then subtract 1,619. So 31,676 - 1,619. Let's do that:\n\n31,676 - 1,000 = 30,676.\n\n30,676 - 600 = 30,076.\n\n30,076 - 19 = 30,057.\n\nSo the result is 30,057. That matches the previous method. So the number of kids who went to camp is approximately 30,057. But the question says \"about how many\", so maybe rounding to the nearest thousand or something. But the exact answer is 30,057.

If they sold 113 t-shirts at $25 each, the total from t-shirts is 113 * 25. And for jerseys, 78 * 115. But the question is asking how much more a jersey costs than a t-shirt.

Hmm, I need to find the difference between the number of books he sold and the number he bought.\n\nFirst, let me break this down. Let's denote the number of books he sold as S and the number he bought as B. We know B is 42. So the question is asking for S - B. But wait, the problem says \"how many more books did he sell than he bought?\" So that's S minus B. But since B is 42, we need to find S and then subtract 42.\n\nLet me think. Initially, he had 21 books. After selling S books, he had 21 - S left. Then he bought 42 new ones, so the total became (21 - S) + 42. And now he has 15 books. So the equation is:\n\n21 - S + 42 = 15\n\nLet me simplify that. 21 + 42 is 63, so:\n\n63 - S = 15\n\nSubtracting 63 from both sides:\n\n-S = 15 - 63\n\n-S = -48\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\nS = 48\n\nSo he sold 48 books.

How many bags of cookies do you have?\" Oh, maybe the question is asking how many bags contain cookies, given that each bag has an equal number of cookies and the total number of cookies is 28. But the user already states they have 14 bags with cookies. So the answer would be 14? But that seems too straightforward. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think. The total number of cookies is 28, and each of the 14 bags has an equal number. So each bag has 28 divided by 14, which is 2 cookies per bag. But the question is asking how many bags of cookies there are. Well, if you have 14 bags, each with cookies, then the number of bags is 14. So the answer would be 14. But that seems too simple.

That makes sense. So total bottles are 12, and each day she uses 6. So 12 divided by 6. Let me do that calculation. 12 divided by 6 is 2. So that would be 2 days. Wait, that seems right. Let me check again. If she uses 6 bottles per day, then each day she consumes 6. So after one day, she'd have 12 - 6 = 6 left. Then the next day, 6 -6 = 0. So yes, that's two days. So the answer should be 2 days.\n</LONG_COT>\n<ANSWER>\n2\n</ANSWER>", "answer": "2", "is_correct": true, "token_count": 238}}

The problem says that during summer break, 907,611 kids from Lawrence county stay home, and 455,682 kids go to camp. They want to know about how many kids are in the county total. Hmm, so I need to add these two numbers together, right?\n\nWait, let me make sure I understand. The total number of kids would be those who stay home plus those who go to camp. So yeah, that's 907,611 plus 455,682. Let me check if I added them correctly.\n\nFirst, let's add the numbers digit by digit. Starting from the right. The units place: 1 (from 907611) plus 2 (from 455682) equals 3. Then the tens place: 1 + 8 = 9. The hundreds place: 6 + 6 = 12, so carry over 1. The thousands place: 7 + 5 = 12, plus the carryover 1 makes 13. So carry over 1 again. The ten thousands place: 0 + 4 = 4, plus the carryover 1 makes 5. The hundred thousands place: 9 + 0 = 9. So putting it all together, it should be 907,611 + 455,682 = 1,363,293. Wait, let me double-check that. Alternatively, maybe there's a quicker way. Let's see:\n\n907,611 is approximately 900,000. 455,682 is approximately 450,000. So 900,000 + 450,000 = 1,350,000. But the exact numbers are a bit more. Let me do the exact addition again. \n\n907,611 + 455,682. Let's add the numbers:\n\n907,611  \n+455,682  \n_________  \nStarting from the right:\n\n1 + 2 = 3  \n1 + 8 = 9  \n6 + 6 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1  \n7 + 5 = 12 + 1 = 13 \u2192 write 3, carry 1  \n0 + 4 = 4 + 1 = 5  \n9 + 0 = 9  \n\nSo the total is 1,363,293. That seems correct. So the total number of kids in Lawrence county is approximately 1,363,293. But the question says \"about how many\", so maybe they want a rounded number. But the exact sum is 1,363,293. So the answer should be that number. Let me check if I did the addition correctly again. Alternatively, maybe there's a miscalculation. Let me add the numbers another way. \n\nAlternatively, 907,611 + 455,682. Let's break it down:\n\n900,000 + 450,000 = 1,350,000  \n7,611 + 5,682 = 13,293  \nSo 1,350,000 + 13,293 = 1,363,293.

Danny found some bottle caps and wrappers at the park, and now he has a total in his collection. The question is asking how many wrappers he had at first. Hmm, maybe I need to set up an equation here.\n\nSo, the problem says he found 66 wrappers and 39 bottle caps at the park. Now, he has 16 bottle caps and 68 wrappers in his collection. Wait, wait. Wait, that doesn't add up. Because the number of bottle caps he found is 39, but now he has 16. That means he must have lost some or maybe some were already in his collection? Wait, no, the problem says he found them at the park. So the total he has now includes what he found and what he already had. Let me think again.\n\nLet me break it down. The wrappers he found at the park are 66. So the total wrappers he has now is 68. That means the wrappers he had before plus the 66 he found equal 68. So the original number of wrappers he had would be 68 minus 66. Let me check that. Yes, because 68 - 66 = 2. So he had 2 wrappers initially. That makes sense. Let me verify with the bottle caps. He found 39 bottle caps. Now he has 16. So the total bottle caps he has now is 16. That means the bottle caps he had before plus the 39 he found equal 16. So the original number of bottle caps would be 16 - 39. But that would be negative. Wait, that can't be. That means he must have lost some or maybe he had some already. But the problem says he found them at the park. So the total he has now is what he had plus what he found. So if he has 16 bottle caps now, and he found 39, then he must have had 16 - 39 = -23.

Wait, the problem says he found 66 wrappers and 39 bottle caps at the park. So that's the number he found. But now he has 16 bottle caps and 68 wrappers in total. So the total he has now includes what he found and what he already had before. So the question is asking how many wrappers he had initially before finding the 66 at the park. Because the total now is 68, which includes the 66 he found plus what he already had. So the initial number of wrappers plus 66 equals 68. So the initial number would be 68 minus 66. Let me check that again.\n\nLet me break it down. Let's say the number of wrappers he had initially is W. Then he found 66 more, so total wrappers now are W + 66. And the problem states that now he has 68 wrappers. So W + 66 = 68. So solving for W, W = 68 - 66 = 2. So he had 2 wrappers initially. Let me check the bottle caps part to make sure I'm not missing anything. He found 39 bottle caps at the park. Now he has 16 bottle caps. So the total bottle caps he has now is the ones he found plus what he already had. So if he found 39, and now has 16, that would imply that he had 16 - 39 = -23 before. But that doesn't make sense. Wait, that can't be. Wait, no, that's impossible. Wait, that would mean he had -23 bottle caps before? That doesn't make sense. So maybe I made a mistake here.

He found 66 wrappers and 39 bottle caps at the park. Now he has 16 bottle caps and 68 wrappers in his collection. How many wrappers did danny have at first?\"\n\nWait, so the total he has now is 16 bottle caps and 68 wrappers. The 66 wrappers and 39 bottle caps are what he found at the park. So the total he had before finding them plus the found ones equals the total now. So for wrappers: initial wrappers + 66 = 68. So initial wrappers = 68 - 66 = 2. That's correct. For bottle caps: initial bottle caps + 39 = 16. So initial bottle caps = 16 - 39 = -23. Which is impossible. So there's a contradiction here. That suggests either the problem is incorrect, or I'm misunderstanding it. Let me read the problem again.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the 66 wrappers and 39 bottle caps are what he found at the park, and now he has 16 bottle caps and 68 wrappers in total.

{"question": "Lewis earns $ 368 every week during the 1359 weeks of harvest. If he has to pay $ 388 rent every week How much money does he pay as rent during the harvest season?", "data_source": "my_data/SVAMP", "ground_truth": "527292", "adaptive": {"response": "<LONG_COT>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about Lewis earning money every week during the harvest season and having to pay rent each week. I need to find out how much he pays as rent during the entire harvest season. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, Lewis earns $368 every week. The harvest season lasts for 1359 weeks. So his total earnings would be his weekly earnings multiplied by the number of weeks. But the question isn't asking about his total earnings. It's asking about the total rent he pays. Oh right, the rent is $388 every week. So I need to calculate the rent per week and then multiply by the number of weeks.\n\nWait, so the rent is $388 per week. So for each week, he pays that amount. So total rent would be 388 times 1359. Let me check that again. Yes, that makes sense. Because each week he has to pay $388, so over 1359 weeks, it's 388 * 1359. \n\nLet me do the multiplication. But maybe I should first make sure I have the numbers right. The harvest season is 1359 weeks. Rent is $388 per week. So total rent is 388 * 1359. Let me compute that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a simpler way. Let me think. Alternatively, maybe the problem is trying to trick me into considering his earnings, but the question only asks about the rent. So the earnings part is a distraction. The question is straightforward: how much does he pay as rent during the harvest season. So it's just rent per week multiplied by the number of weeks. So the answer should be 388 * 1359. Let me calculate that. \n\nWait, let me compute 388 * 1359. Let's break it down. 388 * 1000 = 388,000. 388 * 300 = 116,400. 388 * 50 = 19,400. 388 * 9 = 3,492. So adding those together: 388,000 + 116,400 = 504,400. 504,400 + 19,400 = 523,800. 523,800 + 3,492 = 527,292. So the total rent is $527,292. \n\nWait, let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe there's a miscalculation. Let me do it another way. 1359 weeks. 388 per week. So 388 * 1359. Let's divide 1359 into parts. 1359 = 1000 + 300 + 50 + 9. So:\n\n388 * 1000 = 388,000\n\n388 * 300 = 116,400\n\n388 * 50 = 19,400\n\n388 * 9 = 3,492\n\nAdding them: 388,000 + 116,400 = 504,400. 504,400 + 19,400 = 523,800. 523,800 + 3,492 = 527,292.

So his total earnings would be his weekly earnings multiplied by the number of weeks. But the question isn't asking about his total earnings. It's asking about the total rent he pays. Oh right, the rent is $388 every week. So I need to calculate the total rent by multiplying the weekly rent by the number of weeks.\n\nWait, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. So each week, he earns $368, but that's probably not relevant to the rent calculation. The rent is a separate expense. So the total rent he pays is just 388 dollars per week times 1359 weeks. That makes sense. So the calculation would be 388 * 1359. Let me do that multiplication.\n\nHmm, 388 times 1359. Let me break it down. Maybe I can simplify this. Let's see, 388 * 1359. Alternatively, I can compute 388 * 1000 + 388 * 300 + 388 * 50 + 388 * 9. Let me try that.\n\n388 * 1000 = 388,000\n\n388 * 300 = 116,400\n\n388 * 50 = 19,400\n\n388 * 9 = 3,492\n\nNow add them all together:\n\n388,000 + 116,400 = 504,400\n\n504,400 + 19,400 = 523,800\n\n523,800 + 3,492 = 527,292\n\nSo the total rent he pays is $527,292. Let me double-check that. Alternatively, maybe there's a quicker way to multiply 388 by 1359. Let's try another approach.\n\nAlternatively, 388 * 1359. Let's see, 1359 is 1360 - 1. So 388 * 1360 - 388 * 1. Because (a - b) = a - b. So 388 * 1360 = 388 * (1300 + 60) = 388*1300 + 388*60. Let's compute that.\n\n388 * 1300 = 388 * 1000 * 1.3 = 388,000 * 1.3. Wait, no, maybe better to do 388 * 1300. Let's see:\n\n388 * 1000 = 388,000\n\n388 * 300 = 116,400\n\nSo 388*1300 = 388,000 + 116,400 = 504,400. Then 388*60 = 23,280. So 504,400 + 23,280 = 527,680. Then subtract 388 (since it's 388*1360 - 388*1):\n\n527,680 - 388 = 527,292. Same result. So that's correct.

The problem says that David did 40 more push-ups but 17 less crunches than Zachary. Zachary did 34 push-ups and 62 crunches. I need to find out how many crunches David did.\n\nFirst, let me break down the information. Zachary's numbers are given: 34 push-ups and 62 crunches. David did 40 more push-ups than Zachary. So for the push-ups, David's count would be Zachary's push-ups plus 40. That's 34 + 40. Let me calculate that. 34 + 40 = 74. So David did 74 push-ups.\n\nNow for the crunches. The problem says David did 17 less crunches than Zachary. Zachary did 62 crunches, so David's crunches would be 62 minus 17. Let me do that subtraction. 62 - 17 = 45. So David did 45 crunches.\n\nWait, let me double-check. If Zachary did 62 crunches, subtracting 17 gives 45. That makes sense. So the answer should be 45. Let me just make sure I didn't mix up the operations. The problem says \"but 17 less crunches than Zachary.\" So yes, subtracting 17 from Zachary's crunches gives David's. That's correct.

Let me think. Like, initially, she had some money. She spent part of it, so the remaining is what's left. So the equation would be: Initial amount = Amount spent + Amount left. That makes sense. So adding 78 and 33 should give the total. Let me check that. 78 plus 33 is 111. So the initial amount was 111 dollars. That seems right. Let me double-check.

The problem is about movies and books in the 'crazy silly school' series. There are 8 different movies and 21 different books. I read 7 of the books and watched 4 of the movies.

The total number of movies is 8. I've watched 4 of them. So the number of movies left to watch would be the total minus the ones I've already seen. That's 8 - 4. Let me check that again. 8 total movies, minus 4 watched equals 4 left. Wait, but wait. Wait, no. Wait, 8 minus 4 is 4. So that would mean I have 4 movies left to watch. But let me make sure I'm not mixing up the numbers.\n\nWait, the problem says there are 8 different movies. I've watched 4 of them. So 8 total minus 4 watched equals 4 remaining. That seems right. So the answer should be 4. But let me double-check. The books part is probably a distractor here. The question is only about movies. The books part might be there to test if I read the question carefully. So the numbers for books are 21 books, I read 7. But the question is about movies. So the books part is irrelevant.

Wait, that means Dean is 9 feet tall. Hmm, that seems straightforward.\n\nNow, the water's depth is 9 times Dean's height. So I multiply Dean's height by 9. Dean is 9 feet tall, so 9 times 9 is 81.

The grasshopper jumped 19 inches farther than the frog. So if the frog's jump is, let's say, F inches, then the grasshopper's jump would be F + 19. But the grasshopper's jump is 39, so F + 19 = 39.

So if 86 flew away, that means some of them must have left, but the total that could leave can't exceed the initial number. Wait, that's a problem. Because 86 is more than 45. So that's impossible.

Hmm, right.\n\nWait, so the question is asking how many buses are needed. Let me think. If each bus can hold 3 students, then I need to divide the total number of students by the number of seats per bus. So, 111 divided by 3. Let me do that calculation. 3 times 37 is 111. So, 111 divided by 3 equals 37. So that would mean 37 buses are needed. But wait, what if there's a remainder? Like, if the division didn't come out evenly, you'd have to round up. But in this case, it's exact. So 37 buses should be enough. But let me double-check. 37 buses times 3 seats each is 111 students. Yep, that works.

So the answer should be the total number of movies minus the number you've watched. So 17 movies total, minus 7 you've watched, so 10 left. But wait, but the books part is confusing. Because there are only 4 books. So reading 19 books would mean you read all of them multiple times? But the problem says \"read 19 of the books\", which implies you read 19 different books.

The problem is about comparing the number of kids who went to camp during summer break to those who stayed home. The numbers given are 819058 kids went to camp, and 668278 stayed home. I need to find out how many more kids went to camp than stayed home.\n\nHmm, so the question is asking for the difference between the two numbers. That means I should subtract the number of kids who stayed home from the number who went to camp. Let me write that down to make sure I get it right.\n\nSo, the calculation would be: 819058 (camp) minus 668278 (stayed home). Let me do the subtraction step by step. \n\nFirst, align the numbers by their digits:\n\n819058\n-668278\n________\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n8 (units place) minus 8 is 0.\n5 (tens place) minus 7. Oh, that's a problem because 5 is less than 7. So I need to borrow from the hundreds place. The hundreds place is 0, so I have to borrow from the thousands place. The thousands place is 9. So, borrow 1 from 9, making it 8. The hundreds place becomes 10. Now, borrow 1 from the hundreds place (10) to the tens place, making it 15. Now, 15 minus 7 is 8. So the tens place is 8.\n\nNow the hundreds place: after borrowing, it's 8. Minus 2 (from the hundreds place of the subtrahend). 8 minus 2 is 6.\n\nThousands place: 8 (after borrowing) minus 8 is 0.\n\nTen-thousands place: 1 (from 819058) minus 6. Wait, wait. Wait, let me check again. The original number is 819058. So the digits are:\n\n8 (hundred-thousands), 1 (ten-thousands), 9 (thousands), 0 (hundreds), 5 (tens), 8 (units).\n\nWait, no. Let me write it out correctly. The number 819058 has:\n\nDigits from left to right: 8 (hundred-thousands), 1 (ten-thousands), 9 (thousands), 0 (hundreds), 5 (tens), 8 (units).\n\nSo when we subtract 668278 (which is 6 (hundred-thousands), 6 (ten-thousands), 8 (thousands), 2 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 8 (units)):\n\nLet's do the subtraction digit by digit.\n\nStarting from the right:\n\nUnits: 8 - 8 = 0.\n\nTens: 5 - 7. Can't do that. So borrow 1 from the hundreds place. The hundreds place is 0, so need to borrow from the thousands place. The thousands place is 9. So borrow 1 from 9, making it 8. The hundreds place becomes 10. Now borrow 1 from the hundreds place (10) to the tens place, making it 15. 15 -7 =8. So tens place is 8.\n\nHundreds place: after borrowing, it's 9 (wait, wait. Wait, the original hundreds place was 0. After borrowing from thousands (9), hundreds becomes 10. Then we borrowed 1 from hundreds to tens, so hundreds is 9. Then subtract 2 (from the hundreds place of the subtrahend). 9 -2 =7. So hundreds place is 7.\n\nThousands place: original was 9. After borrowing, it's 8. Subtract 8 (from the thousands place of the subtrahend). 8-8=0. So thousands place is 0.\n\nTen-thousands place: original was 1. Subtract 6. 1-6. Can't do that. So need to borrow from the hundred-thousands place. The hundred-thousands place is 8. So borrow 1, making it 7. The ten-thousands place becomes 11. 11-6=5. So ten-thousands place is 5.\n\nHundred-thousands place: after borrowing, it's 7. Subtract 6. 7-6=1. So hundred-thousands place is 1.\n\nPutting it all together: 1 5 0 7 8 0. So the result is 150780. Let me check that again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a simpler way. Let me verify with another method. Let's add 668278 to 150780. 150780 + 668278 = 819058. Yes, that's correct.

Hmm, I need to find the difference between the number of books he bought and the number he sold.\n\nFirst, let me think about the total changes. He started with 71, then sold some, so that would reduce the number. Then he bought 38, which increases it. Now he has 116. So the equation would be: starting number minus sold plus bought equals current number. So 71 - sold + 38 = 116. Let me write that down.\n\n71 - sold + 38 = 116. Combining the numbers: 71 + 38 = 109. So 109 - sold = 116. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no. Let me check again. Starting with 71, subtract the sold books, then add 38. So 71 - sold + 38 = 116. So combining the constants: 71 + 38 = 109. So 109 - sold = 116. That would mean -sold = 116 - 109 = 7. So sold = -7. But that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let me try again. The equation is 71 - sold + 38 = 116. Combine 71 and 38: 71 + 38 = 109. So 109 - sold = 116. Subtract 109 from both sides: -sold = 116 - 109 = 7. So sold = -7. That's not possible. Wait, that can't be. That would mean he sold a negative number of books, which doesn't make sense. So maybe I set up the equation wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the number of books he sold is not directly given. Let me think again. Let's denote the number of books he sold as S. Then, after selling S books, he has 71 - S books. Then he buys 38, so 71 - S + 38 = 116. Simplify that: 71 + 38 = 109. So 109 - S = 116. Then S = 109 - 116 = -7. That's the same result. So that's incorrect. So maybe there's a mistake in the problem setup.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the number of books he sold is not the same as the number he bought. The question is asking how many more books he bought than he sold. So we need to find bought - sold. He bought 38. So bought is 38. Sold is S. So we need 38 - S. But to find S, we can use the equation. Let's see.\n\nStarting with 71 books. After selling S, he has 71 - S. Then he buys 38, so 71 - S + 38 = 116. So 109 - S = 116. So S = 109 - 116 = -7. That's still the same. So that's impossible. So maybe the problem is incorrect, or I'm misunderstanding it. Wait, perhaps the problem says he bought 38 new ones after selling some, and now he has 116. So the total change is 116 -71 = 45. So he had a net gain of 45 books. He bought 38, so the number he sold must be 38 -45 = -7. Which is impossible. So maybe the problem has a mistake. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the number of books he sold is not the same as the number he bought. Let me check the problem again. The problem says: Paul had 71 books. After selling some in a garage sale he bought 38 new ones. If he has 116 books now How many more books did he buy than he sold? So the question is asking how many more books he bought than he sold. So bought - sold. So bought is 38. Sold is S. So 38 - S. But to find S, we need to set up the equation. Let's do that.\n\nInitial books: 71. After selling S, he has 71 - S. Then he buys 38, so 71 - S + 38 = 116. So 109 - S = 116. So S = 109 - 116 = -7. That's impossible. So maybe the problem is incorrect. Alternatively, maybe the problem is that he sold some books and then bought 38, ending with 116. So the number he sold must be 71 - 116 +38? Let me think. Wait, maybe the problem is that the total change is 116 -71 =45. He bought 38, so the net gain is 38 - S =45. So S=38-45= -7. Which is impossible. So perhaps the problem has a mistake. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read again.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem says that after selling some books, he bought 38 new ones. So the total number of books he has now is 116. So the equation is correct. So maybe the answer is that he sold -7 books, which is impossible. So perhaps the problem is incorrect. Alternatively, maybe the problem is missing some information. But according to the given data, the answer would be 38 - (-7) =45. But that's not possible. So maybe the problem is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking how many more books he bought than he sold. So if he sold S books and bought 38, then 38 - S. But S is -7, so 38 - (-7)=45. So the answer is 45. But that would mean he sold -7 books, which is not possible. So perhaps the problem is incorrect. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the setup. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that he had 71 books, sold some, then bought 38, now has 116. So the equation is 71 - S +38 =116. So 109 - S =116. So S= -7. So he sold -7 books. So he actually gained 7 books by selling? That doesn't make sense. So perhaps the problem is incorrect. Alternatively, maybe the problem is that he sold some books and then bought 38, so the total change is 38 - S =116-71=45. So S=38-45=-7. So the answer is 38 - (-7)=45. So the answer is 45. But that's only if he sold -7 books. Which is impossible. So perhaps the problem is incorrect. Alternatively, maybe the problem is correct, and the answer is 45.

Paul started with 71 books. Then he sold some at a garage sale. After that, he bought 38 new ones. Now he has 116 books. The question is asking how many more books he bought than he sold. Hmm, I need to find the difference between the number of books he bought and the number he sold.\n\nFirst, let me break this down. Let's call the number of books he sold \"S\". So initially, he had 71 books. After selling S books, he had 71 - S books left. Then he bought 38 new ones, so that adds to his total. So the equation would be: 71 - S + 38 = 116. Let me check that. Yes, that makes sense. Because starting with 71, subtract the sold, add the bought, equals the current total.\n\nNow, let's solve for S. Combine the constants first. 71 + 38 is 109. So the equation becomes 109 - S = 116. Wait, that can't be right. Because 109 minus S equals 116? That would mean S is negative. But that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal equation: 71 - S + 38 = 116. Combine 71 and 38: 71 + 38 = 109. So 109 - S = 116. Oh, wait, that's correct. So 109 - S = 116. Subtracting S from 109 gives 116. So S would be 109 - 116 = -7. But that's not possible. Wait, that can't be. That means he sold -7 books? That doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I set up the equation wrong.\n\nWait, let me think again. The problem says he had 71 books, sold some, then bought 38, now has 116. So the total increase is 116 - 71 = 45 books. But he bought 38 new ones. So the number he sold must be 38 - 45 = -7. But that's impossible. Wait, that's conflicting. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the number he sold is such that when you subtract it from 71, then add 38, you get 116. Let me try that again. Let's set up the equation correctly.\n\nInitial books: 71. Sold S books: 71 - S. Bought 38: 71 - S + 38 = 116. So 71 + 38 = 109. 109 - S = 116. So S = 109 - 116 = -7. But that's not possible. So maybe the problem is wrong, or I'm missing something. Wait, perhaps the problem states that after selling some, he bought 38 new ones, and now has 116. So the total increase is 116 - 71 = 45. But he bought 38, so he must have sold 38 - 45 = -7. That's impossible. So maybe the problem has a mistake, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the number he sold is such that 71 - S + 38 = 116. Let's see. 71 + 38 = 109. So 109 - S = 116. So S = 109 - 116 = -7. So that's a negative number. That means he actually gained 7 books by selling? That doesn't make sense. So perhaps the problem is incorrect. Alternatively, maybe I'm making a mistake in setting up the equation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that he sold some books, then bought 38, and now has 116. So the total change is 116 - 71 = 45. So he sold S books, so he lost S books, then added 38. So the net change is -S + 38 = 45. So -S = 45 - 38 = 7. So S = -7. Again, same result. So this suggests that he sold 7 fewer books than he bought. Wait, that's the same as the question. The question asks how many more books he bought than he sold. So if he bought 38 and sold 7, then 38 -7 = 31. But wait, that's not matching. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the number he sold is such that 71 - S + 38 = 116. Let's solve that again. 71 +38 = 109. 109 - S = 116. So S = 109 - 116 = -7. So that's a negative number. So that's impossible. So perhaps the problem is incorrect. Alternatively, maybe there's a miscalculation here.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that he had 71 books, sold some, then bought 38, and now has 116. So the total increase is 116 -71 =45. So he sold S books, so the net is -S +38 =45. So -S=7 \u2192 S= -7. So he sold -7 books. Which means he actually bought 7 more books than he sold. So the answer would be 38 - (-7) = 45. But that's not matching the numbers. Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the initial number was different. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that after selling some, he bought 38, and now has 116. So the equation is correct. So S must be 7. But that's impossible. So perhaps the problem has a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking how many more books he bought than he sold. So if he sold S books and bought 38, then 38 - S. But S is 7. So 38-7=31. So the answer is 31. But that would require S to be 7. But according to the equation, S is -7. So that's conflicting. So perhaps the problem is incorrect. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that he had 71 books, sold some, then bought 38, and now has 116. So the total increase is 116-71=45. He bought 38, so he must have sold 38-45= -7. So that's not possible. So perhaps the problem is wrong. Alternatively, maybe the question is phrased differently. Let me read again.\n\nThe question says: How many more books did he buy than he sold? So if he bought 38 and sold S, then 38 - S. So if S is 7, then 38-7=31. But according to the equation, S is -7. So 38 - (-7)=45. So the answer would be 45. But that seems high. Let me check with the numbers.\n\nIf he sold 7 books, then he would have 71-7=64. Then he buys 38, so 64+38=102. But he has 116 now. So that's not correct. So that's a contradiction. So perhaps the problem is incorrect. Alternatively, maybe the initial number is different. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that he had 71 books, sold some, bought 38, and now has 116. So the equation is correct. So S must be 7. But that's not possible. So maybe the problem is a trick question. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is 38 - S. But S is 7, so 31. So the answer is 31. But according to the equation, S is -7. So that's conflicting. So perhaps the problem is wrong. Alternatively, maybe the setup is correct, and the answer is 45. But that seems high. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that he had 71 books, sold S, then bought 38, so total now is 71 - S +38 =116. So 109 - S =116 \u2192 S= -7. So he actually bought 7 more books than he sold. So the answer is 38 - (-7)=45. So the answer is 45. So that's the correct answer.

The problem says there are 304 grades, and each grade has 75 students. I need to find the total number of students. Hmm, so I think I should multiply the number of grades by the number of students per grade. That makes sense because if each grade has the same number of students, just multiply them.\n\nSo, the calculation would be 304 times 75. Let me think about how to do that multiplication. Maybe I can break it down to make it easier. Like, 75 is the same as 70 + 5. So, 304 times 70 is easier to calculate. Let's see, 304 times 70. Well, 300 times 70 is 21,000, and 4 times 70 is 280. So adding those together, 21,000 + 280 = 21,280. Then, 304 times 5. That's 300 times 5 is 1,500, and 4 times 5 is 20. So 1,500 + 20 = 1,520. Now add the two results together: 21,280 + 1,520. Let's add 21,280 + 1,000 = 22,280, then +520 = 22,800. So the total should be 22,800. Wait, let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe there's a simpler way. Let's do 304 * 75. Another approach: 75 is 75/100 = 0.75. So 304 * 75 = 304 * 75. Let's compute 304 * 70 = 21,280 and 304 *5=1,520. Adding them gives 21,280 +1,520=22,800. Yep, that's the same result.

The problem is asking how many students there are in total if there are 304 grades and each grade has 75 students. Hmm, so I need to find the total number of students. Alright, let me think.\n\nSo, each grade has 75 students. That means for one grade, it's 75. But there are 304 grades. So I guess I need to multiply the number of grades by the number of students per grade. That makes sense. Like, if you have a certain number of groups and each group has the same number of people, you multiply them to get the total.\n\nLet me write that down. The total number of students would be 304 multiplied by 75. So, 304 \u00d7 75. Let me check if that's correct. Yeah, that should give the total. Now, I need to do the multiplication. Hmm, 304 times 75. Let me break it down to make it easier.\n\nI know that 75 is the same as 70 + 5. So maybe I can do 304 \u00d7 70 and then 304 \u00d7 5, and add them together. Let's try that. \n\nFirst, 304 \u00d7 70. Well, 304 \u00d7 70. 70 is 7 \u00d7 10, so 304 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 10. 304 \u00d77. Let's compute that. 300 \u00d77 = 2100, and 4\u00d77=28. So 2100+28=2128. Then multiply by 10 to get 21280. So 304\u00d770=21280.\n\nNow, 304 \u00d75. That's easier. 300\u00d75=1500, and 4\u00d75=20. So 1500+20=1520. So 304\u00d75=1520.\n\nNow add the two results together: 21280 + 1520. Let's add them. 21280 + 1500 = 22780, and then +20 = 22800. So the total should be 22800. Let me double-check. Another way to do 304 \u00d775. Maybe 304 \u00d775. 75 is 3/4 of 100. So 304 \u00d775 = 304 \u00d7 (3/4 \u00d7100) = (304 \u00d73/4) \u00d7100. Let's compute 304 \u00f74 =76. 76\u00d73=228. So 228 \u00d7100=22800. Yep, same answer. So that confirms it.

Wait, the question says \"how much more does a t-shirt cost than a jersey?\" But the numbers given are the profits they make per item. So the $192 is the profit per t-shirt, and $34 is the profit per jersey. So the question is actually asking for the difference in profit between a t-shirt and a jersey, not the price difference. Because the profit per item would depend on the cost price and the selling price. But the question might be a bit ambiguous. Let me read it again.\n\n\"The Razorback shop makes $192 dollars off each t-shirt and $34 off each jersey. During the Arkansas and Texas tech game they sold 157 t-shirts and 19 jerseys. How much more does a t-shirt cost than a jersey?\"\n\nWait, the wording is a bit confusing. \"How much more does a t-shirt cost than a jersey?\" That would imply the price difference. But the numbers given are the profit per item. So maybe the question is phrased incorrectly. Let me think. If the question is about the profit, then the answer would be $192 - $34 = $158. But if it's about the price, then we need more information. But the problem gives the profit per item, so perhaps the question is asking for the difference in profit. Let me check the question again.\n\nThe question says: \"How much more does a t-shirt cost than a jersey?\" That would be the price difference. But the numbers given are the profit per item. So perhaps there's a mistake in the question. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking how much more profit they make per t-shirt compared to a jersey. In that case, the answer would be $192 - $34 = $158. But the problem mentions the number of items sold, which seems irrelevant if the question is just about the difference in profit per item. Let me check the problem again.\n\nWait, the problem states: \"How much more does a t-shirt cost than a jersey?\" That would be the price difference. But the numbers given are the profit per item. So perhaps the question is incorrect. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking how much more profit they made from t-shirts compared to jerseys. But that would require multiplying the number of items sold by the profit per item. Let me see.\n\nIf the question is asking how much more profit they made from t-shirts than jerseys, then the calculation would be (157 * 192) - (19 * 34). Let me compute that. 157 * 192: Let's see, 150*192=28,800, 7*192=1,344. So 28,800 +1,344=30,144. Then 19*34: 10*34=340, 9*34=306. So 340+306=646. So 30,144 - 646 = 29,498. So that's the total difference in profit. But the question asks \"how much more does a t-shirt cost than a jersey?\" Which would be the per-item difference. So maybe the question is phrased incorrectly. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the difference in profit per item. In that case, the answer is 192-34=158.

The problem says that Ed had 6 more marbles than Doug. Then Doug lost 7 marbles at the playground. Now Ed has 22 marbles, and we need to find out how many Doug has now. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that Ed has 22 marbles right now. The problem states that Ed had 6 more marbles than Doug. So maybe I should start by figuring out how many marbles Doug had before he lost any. Let me think. If Ed has 6 more than Doug, then Doug's original number must be Ed's number minus 6. Wait, no. Let me be careful. Let's say Doug originally had D marbles. Then Ed had D + 6 marbles. But wait, the problem says \"Ed had 6 more marbles than Doug.\" So yes, that's correct. So Ed's marbles = Doug's marbles + 6. \n\nBut wait, the problem also says that Ed has 22 marbles now. So Ed's current marbles are 22. So that means D + 6 = 22. So solving for D, that would be D = 22 - 6 = 16. So Doug originally had 16 marbles. Then Doug lost 7 marbles. So now Doug has 16 - 7 = 9 marbles. Let me check that again. If Doug originally had 16, then Ed had 16 + 6 = 22, which matches the given information. Then Doug lost 7, so 16 -7 =9. That makes sense.

So I guess I need to subtract the number of mashed potato suggestions from the total number of students. Let me check that again.\n\nTotal students = 310. Mashed potatoes = 185. So Bacon = Total - Mashed potatoes. That makes sense. So 310 minus 185. Let me do the math. 310 minus 185. Let's see, 310 - 180 is 130, and then minus 5 more is 125. So the answer should be 125.

Lewis earns $403 every week during the harvest season. The harvest season lasts 233 weeks. He has to pay $49 rent every week. I need to find out how much money he earns during the harvest season after paying the rent each week.\n\nFirst, I should calculate his total earnings before any deductions. That would be his weekly earnings multiplied by the number of weeks. So, 403 dollars per week times 233 weeks. Let me do that multiplication. Hmm, 400 times 233 is 93,200, and 3 times 233 is 699. So adding those together, 93,200 + 699 = 93,899. So his total earnings before rent are $93,899.\n\nNow, he has to pay rent every week. The rent is $49 per week. So the total rent he pays over 233 weeks is 49 times 233. Let me calculate that. 40 times 233 is 9,320, and 9 times 233 is 2,097. So 9,320 + 2,097 = 11,417. So the total rent paid is $11,417.\n\nTo find out how much he earns after paying the rent, I subtract the total rent from his total earnings. So 93,899 - 11,417. Let's do that subtraction. 93,899 minus 10,000 is 83,899. Then add back 583 (since 11,417 - 10,000 = 1,417, so 1,417 - 583 = 834). Wait, maybe a better way. 93,899 - 11,417. Let's break it down:\n\n93,899 - 10,000 = 83,899\n\n83,899 - 1,417 = 82,482\n\nSo the final amount he earns after paying rent is $82,482.\n</LONG_COT>\n<ANSWER>\n82482\n</ANSWER>", "answer": "82482", "is_correct": false, "token_count": 533}}

The question says \"how many more visitors visited the Buckingham palace on that day than on the previous 245 days?\" Wait, that can't be right. Because the numbers given are for three specific days: the current day, the previous day, and the day before that. So the total for the previous two days would be 191 + 457.

Matthew has 13 crackers and 15 cakes. He wants to give an equal number of crackers and cakes to each of his 28 friends. Hmm, the problem is asking how many crackers and cakes each person ate. Wait, but he can't give the same number of each if he has different amounts initially. Oh, wait, no. Wait, the question says he gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to each friend. So each friend gets the same number of crackers and the same number of cakes. But he has 13 crackers and 15 cakes. So the number of crackers each friend gets has to be a divisor of 13, and the number of cakes each gets has to be a divisor of 15. But since he's giving them to 28 friends, the number of crackers each gets must also be such that 13 divided by that number is an integer, and similarly for the cakes. Wait, no. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, the problem says he gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to each of his 28 friends. So each friend gets the same number of crackers and the same number of cakes. But he has 13 crackers and 15 cakes. So the number of crackers each gets must be 13 divided by the number of friends, and the number of cakes each gets is 15 divided by the number of friends. But since the number of friends is 28, which is more than both 13 and 15, he can't give each friend a whole number of crackers or cakes. That doesn't make sense. Wait, but the problem says he gave equal numbers. So perhaps he can only give each friend as many as the minimum of crackers and cakes he has per friend. But that wouldn't make sense either. Wait, maybe I'm misreading the question.\n\nLet me read again. \"Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his 28 friends. If he had 13 crackers and 15 cakes initially. How many crackers and cakes did each person eat?\" So each friend gets the same number of crackers and the same number of cakes. So the number of crackers each gets is 13 divided by 28, and the number of cakes each gets is 15 divided by 28. But that would be a fraction. But the problem says \"how many crackers and cakes did each person eat?\" So the answer would be fractions. But the problem might expect whole numbers. Wait, but that's impossible. Because 13 and 15 are not divisible by 28. So maybe there's a mistake in the problem. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that he gave each friend the same number of crackers and the same number of cakes, but the total number of crackers and cakes he has is 13 and 15 respectively. So the number of crackers each gets is 13 divided by the number of friends, and the number of cakes each gets is 15 divided by the number of friends. But since the number of friends is 28, which is more than both 13 and 15, each friend would get a fraction of a cracker and a cake. But the problem asks for the number each person ate, so the answer would be 13/28 crackers and 15/28 cakes per person. But that's not a whole number. So perhaps the problem has a mistake, or maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking how many crackers and cakes each person ate, but perhaps he can only distribute as many as possible. But that would involve finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 13 and 15, which is 1. So the maximum number of crackers and cakes each can get is 1 each, but then he would have 13-28= -15 crackers left, which is impossible. So that's not possible. So perhaps the problem is incorrect. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, maybe the question is phrased incorrectly. Let me read again. \"Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his 28 friends. If he had 13 crackers and 15 cakes initially. How many crackers and cakes did each person eat?\" So each friend gets the same number of crackers and the same number of cakes. So the total number of crackers given out is 13, and the total number of cakes is 15. So each friend gets 13/28 crackers and 15/28 cakes. But that's not a whole number. So perhaps the problem is expecting a fractional answer. But the question says \"how many\", which usually implies a whole number. So maybe there's a mistake in the problem. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that he split the crackers and cakes into equal groups, each group having the same number of crackers and cakes. But that's not what the question says. The question says he gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to each friend. So each friend gets the same number of crackers and the same number of cakes. So the number of crackers each gets is 13 divided by 28, and the number of cakes each gets is 15 divided by 28. So the answer would be 13/28 crackers and 15/28 cakes per person. But that's not a whole number. So perhaps the problem is incorrect. Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick question. Let me check the numbers again. 13 crackers and 15 cakes divided among 28 friends. So each gets 13/28 crackers and 15/28 cakes. So the answer is \\boxed{\\frac{13}{28}} crackers and \\boxed{\\frac{15}{28}} cakes per person. But that's not a whole number. So perhaps the problem expects that, but it's unusual. Alternatively, maybe there's a miscalculation. Let me check again. 13 divided by 28 is 0.464285... and 15 divided by 28 is approximately 0.535714. So each person gets approximately 0.464 crackers and 0.536 cakes. So the answer would be fractions. So the answer is \\boxed{\\frac{13}{28}} crackers and \\boxed{\\frac{15}{28}} cakes per person. But that's the correct mathematical answer. So maybe that's the intended answer. So the answer is \\boxed{\\frac{13}{28}} and \\boxed{\\frac{15}{28}}.\n</LONG_COT>\n<ANSWER>\n13/28\n</ANSWER>", "answer": "13/28", "is_correct": false, "token_count": 1454}}

Hmm, I need to find the number of houses per block.\n\nFirst, let me break down the information. Each block gets 32 pieces of junk mail. So for one block, the total mails are 32. Then, each house in the block gets 8 mails. So if each house gets 8, the number of houses must be the total mails divided by the mails per house. That makes sense.

So the answer would be 65 (wrappers found) minus 5 (bottle caps found) equals 60. So the answer is 60. That seems straightforward. Let me double-check.\n\nThe problem states that he found 65 wrappers and 5 bottle caps at the park. So the difference is 65-5=60. So he found 60 more wrappers than bottle caps. That's the answer.

If they sold 47 t-shirts during the Arkansas game How much money did they make from selling the t-shirts?", "data_source": "my_data/SVAMP", "ground_truth": "8265", "adaptive": {"response": "<LONG_COT>\nOkay, let's see. The problem says that the Razorback t-shirt shop makes $87 off each t-shirt sold. They sold a total of 95 t-shirts during the Arkansas game and the Texas tech game. During the Arkansas game, they sold 47 t-shirts. I need to find out how much money they made from selling all the t-shirts.\n\nHmm, first, I should figure out how many t-shirts they sold during the Texas tech game. Since the total is 95 and they sold 47 during the Arkansas game, I can subtract 47 from 95. Let me do that calculation. 95 minus 47. Let's see, 95 - 40 is 55, and then minus 7 is 48. So they sold 48 t-shirts during the Texas tech game.\n\nNow, each t-shirt brings $87. So the total money from the Arkansas game would be 47 t-shirts multiplied by 87 dollars each. And the total from the Texas tech game would be 48 t-shirts multiplied by 87 dollars each. Then I need to add those two amounts together to get the total money made.\n\nLet me compute each part separately. First, 47 times 87. Let's break it down. 40 times 87 is 3480, and 7 times 87 is 609. So 3480 + 609 = 4089. So that's $4089 from the Arkansas game.\n\nThen, 48 times 87. Let's do the same. 40 times 87 is 3480, and 8 times 87 is 696. So 3480 + 696 = 4176. So that's $4176 from the Texas tech game.\n\nNow add the two amounts: 4089 + 4176. Let's add them. 4000 + 4000 = 8000. 89 + 176 = 265. So 8000 + 265 = 8265. So the total money made is $8265.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe there's a simpler way. The total t-shirts sold is 95, each making $87. So total money would be 95 * 87. Let me compute that. 90*87=7830, 5*87=435. So 7830+435=8265. Yep, that's the same result.

Hmm, I need to find the difference between Ed's and Doug's marbles after Ed lost some.\n\nFirst, let me break it down. Let's start by figuring out how many marbles Ed had before he lost any. The problem states that after losing 21 marbles, Ed has 91. So maybe I can work backwards here. If Ed lost 21 marbles and now has 91, then originally he must have had 91 + 21 marbles. Let me check that. Yes, because 91 + 21 = 112. So Ed originally had 112 marbles.\n\nNow, the problem says that Ed had 30 more marbles than Doug. So if Ed originally had 112, then Doug must have had 112 - 30 marbles. Let me calculate that. 112 - 30 = 82. So Doug had 82 marbles originally.\n\nBut wait, the question is about how many more marbles Ed has than Doug now, after Ed lost some. So now Ed has 91 marbles, and Doug still has his original amount, which is 82. So the difference now is 91 - 82. Let me do that subtraction. 91 - 82 = 9.

Danny collects bottle caps. The problem says he found 30 at the park and threw away 63 old ones. Now he has 42 in his collection. The question is asking how many more bottle caps he threw away than those he found. Hmm, okay, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many bottle caps Danny had before he found the 30 and threw away the 63. Let's think. Let's call the original number of bottle caps he had \"x\". So originally, he had x caps. Then he found 30 more, so that's x + 30. But then he threw away 63, so subtracting those, he has (x + 30) - 63. And the result is 42. So the equation would be:\n\n(x + 30) - 63 = 42\n\nLet me simplify that. x + 30 - 63 = 42. That simplifies to x - 33 = 42. Then adding 33 to both sides: x = 42 + 33 = 75. So originally, he had 75 bottle caps.\n\nWait, but let me check that. If he started with 75, found 30, so 75 +30 = 105. Then threw away 63, so 105 -63 = 42. Yep, that matches the problem statement. So that's correct. So originally he had 75.\n\nBut the question is asking how many more he threw away than those he found. He found 30 and threw away 63. So the difference is 63 -30 = 33. So the answer should be 33.

Lewis earns $21 every week during the harvest season. The harvest season is 216 weeks long. He has to pay $702 in taxes. I need to find out how much money he will have at the end of the season.\n\nFirst, I should calculate his total earnings before taxes. That would be his weekly earnings multiplied by the number of weeks. So, $21 per week times 216 weeks. Let me do that multiplication. 21 times 200 is 4200, and 21 times 16 is 336.

Lewis earns $21 every week during the harvest season. The harvest season is 216 weeks long. He has to pay $702 in taxes. I need to find out how much money he will have at the end of the season.\n\nFirst, I should calculate his total earnings before taxes. That would be his weekly earnings multiplied by the number of weeks. So, $21 per week times 216 weeks. Let me do that multiplication. 21 times 200 is 4200, and 21 times 16 is 336.

The problem is about roses in a vase. Initially, there were 21 roses. Then Jessica threw away 34 roses. Wait, wait, that can't be right. If she threw away 34 roses from a vase that only had 21, that wouldn't make sense. Oh, wait, maybe the problem says she threw away 34 roses from the vase?

Jessica threw away 34 roses from the vase and cut some more new roses to put in the vase. Now there are 15 roses in the vase. How many more roses did she throw away than those she cut from her garden?\n\nHmm, that's confusing. If she threw away 34 roses from a vase that had 21, that's not possible. So maybe the problem has a mistake. Alternatively, maybe she threw away 34 roses in total, some from the vase and some from elsewhere? But the problem says she threw away 34 roses from the vase. That would mean she took 34 roses out of the vase. But the vase only had 21. So that's impossible. So perhaps there's a mistake in the problem.

There are now 15 roses in the vase. How many more roses did she throw away than those she cut from her garden?\"\n\nSo the initial number is 21. She threw away 34 from the vase. Then she added some new ones. Now there are 15. So the calculation would be: initial 21 - 34 + added = 15. But 21 -34 is -13. So -13 + added =15. So added =28. So she added 28 roses. But she threw away 34. So 34-28=6. So she threw away 6 more than she added. Wait, but that would mean she threw away 34 and added 28, so 34-28=6. So the answer is 6. But wait, that assumes she threw away 34 from the vase. But the vase only had 21. So that's impossible. So maybe the problem has a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the problem meant she threw away 34 roses in total, some from the vase and some from elsewhere. But the problem says she threw away 34 roses from the vase. So that's conflicting. Unless maybe the problem is correct and I need to proceed with the given numbers, even if it's impossible. Let me try that.\n\nSo initial: 21. She throws away 34 from the vase. So 21 -34 = -13. Then she adds some new roses. Let's say she added x roses. So -13 + x =15. So x=28. So she added 28. So she threw away 34 and added 28. So 34-28=6. So the answer is 6.

So that must mean she took some out and then added some back. Let me think. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nInitially, there are 21 roses. Jessica throws away 34. So that would leave 21 - 34 = -13 roses. But that's impossible. So maybe the problem is that she threw away 34 roses from the vase, but she also added some new ones.

So the total number of roses after throwing away and adding would be 15. Let me set up an equation.\n\nLet's let x be the number of roses she cut and added. So initially, 21 roses. She throws away 34, so 21 - 34 = -13. Then she adds x roses. So -13 + x = 15. Solving for x: x = 15 +13 = 28. So she added 28 roses. But she threw away 34.

Like, if Jake has 17, then Steven must have 17 plus 11. Because subtracting 11 from Steven's amount gives Jake's amount. So the equation would be Steven's peaches minus 11 equals Jake's peaches. So Steven's peaches = Jake's peaches + 11. \n\nWait, let me check that again. If Steven has S peaches and Jake has J peaches, the problem states J = S - 11. But we know J is 17.

If Steven has 28, then 28 minus 11 is 17, which is Jake's amount. Yep, that works.\n</LONG_COT>\n<ANSWER>\n28\n</ANSWER>", "answer": "28", "is_correct": true, "token_count": 282}}
{"question": "Frank was reading through his favorite book. The book had 193 pages equally distributed over 15 chapters. It took Frank 660 days to finish the book. How many chapters did he read per day?", "data_source": "my_data/SVAMP", "ground_truth": "44", "adaptive": {"response": "<LONG_COT>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about Frank reading a book. The book has 193 pages distributed equally over 15 chapters. He took 660 days to finish the book. The question is asking how many chapters he read per day. Hmm, I need to find the number of chapters he read each day.\n\nFirst, I should make sure I understand the problem correctly. The total number of pages is 193, and these are equally distributed across 15 chapters. So each chapter has the same number of pages. But wait, 193 divided by 15. Let me check that. 15 times 12 is 180, so 193 minus 180 is 13. So each chapter would have 12 pages, with 13 pages left over. But the problem says the pages are equally distributed. That might mean each chapter has the same number of pages, so maybe there's a mistake here. Wait, maybe the problem meant that the chapters are equally distributed in some other way, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the total pages are 193, and each chapter has an equal number of pages. But 193 divided by 15 is 12.866..., which is not a whole number. That doesn't make sense for pages. So perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement. But maybe I should proceed anyway.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is about the chapters themselves, not the pages. Wait, the question is asking how many chapters he read per day. So the total number of chapters is 15. He took 660 days to finish the book. So the total chapters divided by the total days gives the chapters per day. Let me think.\n\nTotal chapters: 15. Total days: 660. So chapters per day = 15 / 660. Let me compute that. 15 divided by 660. Simplify the fraction. Both numerator and denominator divisible by 15. 15/660 = 1/44. So 1/44 chapters per day. That's approximately 0.0227 chapters per day. But that seems a bit odd. Wait, but the problem says he finished the book in 660 days. So if each chapter is 15 chapters, then each day he reads 15/660 = 1/44 chapters. So that's correct. So the answer would be 1/44. But the question asks for how many chapters he read per day. So the answer is 1/44. But let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read again. \"How many chapters did he read per day?\" So total chapters is 15. Total days is 660. So 15 divided by 660 is 1/44. So yes, that's correct. So the answer is 1/44. But wait, the problem might have a different interpretation. For example, maybe the pages are distributed equally, but that's not relevant here. The question is about chapters, not pages. So the total number of chapters is 15. So the answer is 15 divided by 660, which is 1/44.

Hmm, I need to find the number of chapters he read each day.\n\nFirst, I should make sure I understand the problem correctly. The total number of pages is 193, and these are equally distributed across 15 chapters. So each chapter has the same number of pages. Then, Frank took 660 days to read the entire book. The question is about the rate at which he read the chapters per day, not the pages. So the answer should be the number of chapters he read each day.\n\nWait, but the pages are equally distributed. Does that matter? Well, the total number of pages is 193, so each chapter has 193 divided by 15 pages. But the problem isn't asking about pages per day, it's about chapters per day. So the number of pages per chapter might not be directly relevant here. Maybe it's a distraction? Let me think.\n\nThe total number of chapters is 15. He took 660 days to read all of them. So the total chapters divided by the total days gives the chapters per day. That makes sense. So the calculation would be 15 chapters divided by 660 days. Let me check that.\n\nYes, that's right. Because if he read all 15 chapters in 660 days, then each day he read 15/660 chapters. Simplifying that fraction. Let's see, 15 divided by 660. Both numbers are divisible by 15. 15/660 = 1/44. So that's 1/44 chapters per day. Wait, that seems quite a small number. Let me confirm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check. The total chapters are 15. Total days are 660. So 15 / 660 = 0.0227 chapters per day. That's approximately 0.0227. So that's about 1 chapter every 44 days. That seems correct. So the answer should be 1/44 chapters per day, which is approximately 0.0227. But the question might expect a fraction. Let me write it as a fraction. 15 divided by 660. Simplify: divide numerator and denominator by 15. 15/660 = 1/44. So the answer is 1/44. That's the exact value.

If each plank needs 3 pieces of nails to be secured and an additional 8 nails were used. How many planks does John need for the house wall?\"\n\nHmm, the wording is a bit unclear. Let me break it down. The total number of nails used is 11. Each plank requires 3 nails. But then there's an additional 8 nails used. Wait, that doesn't add up. Because if each plank uses 3 nails, and there's an additional 8, the total would be 3n + 8, where n is the number of planks. But the total is 11. So maybe the equation is 3n + 8 = 11. Let me check that.\n\nSo, if each plank uses 3 nails, and there's an additional 8 nails used elsewhere (like for something else, maybe?), then the total nails would be 3n + 8. But the total is 11. So 3n + 8 = 11. Solving for n: 3n = 11 - 8 = 3. So n = 1. So John needs 1 plank. That seems straightforward. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is phrased differently.

If each plank needs 3 pieces of nails to be secured and an additional 8 nails were used. How many planks does John need for the house wall?\"\n\nHmm, the wording is a bit mixed. Let me try to parse it. The total number of nails used is 11. Each plank requires 3 nails to secure it. But then there's an additional 8 nails used. Wait, that doesn't quite add up. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nLet me break it down. The total nails used are 11. Each plank requires 3 nails. But then there's an additional 8 nails used. That doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps the problem is saying that each plank needs 3 nails, and then there's an extra 8 nails used for something else? But that would mean the total nails are 3 times the number of planks plus 8. But the total is 11. So let's set up an equation.\n\nLet me denote the number of planks as \\( p \\). Each plank uses 3 nails, so that's \\( 3p \\) nails. Then there's an additional 8 nails used. So total nails = \\( 3p + 8 \\). But the total is 11. So:\n\n\\[ 3p + 8 = 11 \\]\n\nSubtract 8 from both sides:\n\n\\[ 3p = 3 \\]\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\n\n\\[ p = 1 \\]\n\nSo John needs 1 plank. Let me check. If he has 1 plank, that's 3 nails.

Paige had 16 goldfish and 71 catfish in the pond. But some were eaten by stray cats, and now she has 2 left. The question is asking how many goldfish disappeared. Hmm, wait, the total number of fish she had initially was 16 + 71. Let me add that up. 16 plus 71 is 87. So she started with 87 fish total. Now she has 2 left. That means 87 minus 2 equals 85 fish were eaten. But the question specifically asks about the goldfish that disappeared. So out of those 85 fish that were eaten, how many were goldfish? Well, originally she had 16 goldfish. So if all the goldfish were eaten, that's 16. But maybe some catfish were also eaten. But the total eaten is 85. So the number of goldfish that disappeared would be the initial number of goldfish minus the number left. Wait, but the problem doesn't say how many goldfish are left. Oh, wait, the total left is 2. But the question is only about goldfish. So maybe all the goldfish were eaten, and some catfish were left. Let me think. Let's denote the number of goldfish left as G and catfish left as C. We know G + C = 2. But the problem doesn't give any information about how many of each are left. Wait, but the problem says \"how many goldfish disappeared?\" So the initial number of goldfish was 16. The number left is G. So the disappeared goldfish would be 16 - G. But we don't know G. But the total fish eaten is 85. So maybe we can set up equations. Let's let G' be the goldfish left, C' be the catfish left. So G' + C' = 2. The number of goldfish eaten is 16 - G', and catfish eaten is 71 - C'. The total eaten is (16 - G') + (71 - C') = 85. Simplifying that: 16 - G' + 71 - C' = 85. Which is 87 - (G' + C') = 85. But G' + C' is 2. So 87 - 2 = 85. That's correct. So that equation holds. So the number of goldfish eaten is 16 - G'. But we don't know G'. But the total eaten is 85, which is the sum of goldfish and catfish eaten. So if we let G' be the goldfish left, then the goldfish eaten is 16 - G'. The catfish eaten is 71 - C'. But C' = 2 - G'. So substituting, catfish eaten is 71 - (2 - G') = 71 - 2 + G' = 69 + G'. So total eaten is (16 - G') + (69 + G') = 85. Simplifying, 16 - G' + 69 + G' = 85. The G' terms cancel out. 16 + 69 = 85. Which is true. So that confirms it. So the number of goldfish eaten is 16 - G'. But we don't know G'. But the total eaten is 85, which is the sum of goldfish and catfish eaten. So if all the goldfish were eaten, that's 16. Then the catfish eaten would be 85 -16 = 69. But then the catfish left would be 71 -69 =2. So that would mean G' =0. So if all goldfish were eaten, then catfish left is 2. That fits. So the answer would be 16 goldfish disappeared. Because if all 16 were eaten, and 69 catfish were eaten, then 2 catfish are left. So that's possible. So the answer is 16.\n</LONG_COT>\n<ANSWER>\n16\n</ANSWER>", "answer": "16", "is_correct": false, "token_count": 911}}

The problem is about figuring out how many days it will take to fill 240 drums of grapes. The information given is that 36 pickers fill 8 drums per day. Hmm, I need to find the number of days required to reach 240 drums.\n\nFirst, I should probably find out how many drums one picker can fill in a day. If 36 pickers fill 8 drums per day, then each picker contributes a fraction of that. So maybe I divide the total drums per day by the number of pickers. Let me check that. So 8 drums divided by 36 pickers. That gives each picker filling 8/36 drums per day. Simplifying that, 8 divided by 36 is the same as 2/9. So each picker does 2/9 of a drum per day.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a simpler way. Alternatively, maybe the total drums per day is 8, so if I need 240 drums, I divide 240 by 8. That would give the number of days. Let me try that. 240 divided by 8 is 30. So that would be 30 days. But wait, that seems too simple. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of pickers affects the total. Like, if more pickers means more drums per day. So the rate is 8 drums per day with 36 pickers.

Because the problem states that 36 pickers fill 8 drums per day. So the rate is 8 drums per day regardless of the number of pickers? That might be the case. So then the calculation is straightforward. If they fill 8 drums each day, then 240 divided by 8 is 30 days. So the answer would be 30. But let me double-check.\n\nWait, another approach: Suppose each picker's contribution is part of the total. But if the total is 8 drums per day with 36 pickers, then each picker's contribution is 8/36 per day. So per day, total is 8. So to get 240 drums, divide 240 by 8. Yep, that's 30. So that's the correct approach. The number of pickers is a red herring here? Because the problem says \"he was told by 36 of the pickers that they fill 8 drums per day.\" So the rate is 8 drums per day, regardless of how many pickers are involved.

After that, she has 55 Ace cards and 178 baseball cards left. The question is asking how many more baseball cards than Ace cards she has now. So I need to find the difference between the number of baseball cards and Ace cards she has now.\n\nWait, let me check the numbers again. Initially, baseball cards were 438, now 178. Ace cards were 18, now 55. So the question is 178 (baseball) minus 55 (Ace) equals what? Let me do that subtraction. 178 minus 55. Let's see, 178 - 50 is 128, and then minus 5 more is 123.

Hmm, so I need to find the difference between the number of baseball cards and Ace cards she has left.\n\nFirst, let me note down the numbers. Originally, she had 438 baseball and 18 Ace. After giving some to Jeff, she has 178 baseball and 55 Ace. So the difference would be 178 minus 55. Let me do that calculation. 178 - 55 equals 123.

Let me think.\n\nLet me break it down. Initial number: 15. She threw away 33. So 15 - 33 = -18. Then she added some new roses. Let's say she added x roses. So -18 + x = 17.

The problem is about Lewis earning money every week during a harvest season. So, he earns $1357 each week, and each harvest season is 223 weeks long. The question is asking how much he will earn if he works for 73 harvest seasons. Hmm, I need to calculate the total earnings here.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how much he earns in one harvest season. Since he makes $1357 per week and each season is 223 weeks, I multiply those two numbers. So, 1357 times 223. Let me do that calculation. Let me break it down to make it easier. \n\n1357 multiplied by 200 is 271,400. Then 1357 multiplied by 20 is 27,140. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 223 is 200 + 20 + 3. So maybe another approach. Let me try another way. \n\n1357 * 223. Let's compute 1357 * 200 = 271,400. Then 1357 * 20 = 27,140. And 1357 * 3 = 4,071. So adding those together: 271,400 + 27,140 = 298,540. Then 298,540 + 4,071 = 302,611. So each harvest season he earns $302,611. \n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check again. 1357 * 223. Let's do it step by step. \n\n223 can be written as 200 + 20 + 3. So:\n\n1357 * 200 = 271,400\n\n1357 * 20 = 27,140\n\n1357 * 3 = 4,071\n\nAdding them: 271,400 + 27,140 = 298,540. 298,540 + 4,071 = 302,611. Yes, that's correct. So each season he earns $302,611. \n\nNow, if he works for 73 harvest seasons, I need to multiply that by 73. So 302,611 * 73. Let's break this down. \n\n302,611 * 70 = 21,182,770\n\n302,611 * 3 = 907,833\n\nAdding those together: 21,182,770 + 907,833 = 22,090,603. \n\nSo the total amount he will earn is $22,090,603. Let me double-check the calculations. \n\nFirst, 302,611 *70: 302,611 *7 = 2,118,277. So 2,118,277 *10 = 21,182,770. Correct. Then 302,611 *3 = 907,833. Adding them: 21,182,770 + 907,833 = 22,090,603. That seems right.

Let's see, 100 times 3 is 300, but since it's 99, it's 300 minus 3, which is 297. So the total cost is $297. \n\nWait, but Dan only has $4. That's way less than $297. Oh, wait, that can't be right. Did I misunderstand the problem? Let me read again. Oh, wait, the problem says he bought 99 candy bars for $3 each. But Dan only has $4. That's impossible. There's a mistake here. Because 99 candy bars at $3 each would cost way more than $4. So maybe there's a mistake in the problem statement. Alternatively, maybe I misread it.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a trick question. Like, maybe he didn't buy all 99, but only as many as he can afford. But the problem says he bought 99. So that's a contradiction. So maybe the problem has a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the numbers are correct, but the question is a trick. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is correct, and the answer is that he can't buy any, so he has all his money left. But that would be $4. But the problem says he bought 99 candy bars. So that's impossible. So perhaps the problem is a trick question. Alternatively, maybe the numbers are wrong. Let me check the calculation again. 99 *3 = 297. Yes. So 297 is way more than 4. So the answer would be that he can't buy any, so he has $4 left. But the problem says he bought 99. So that's a contradiction. So maybe the problem is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the question is a trick. Like, maybe the candy bars are priced per pack or something. But the problem says each candy bar costs $3. So unless there's a miscalculation, the answer is that he can't buy any, so he has $4 left. But the problem says he bought 99. So perhaps the problem is incorrect. Alternatively, maybe the numbers are supposed to be different. For example, maybe he has $297. Then the answer would be zero. But the problem says he has $4. So I think the problem is incorrect, but perhaps the intended answer is that he can't buy any, so he has $4 left. But the problem says he bought 99. So there's a contradiction. So maybe the problem is a trick question. Alternatively, perhaps the numbers are reversed. Like, maybe he has $297 and bought 99 candy bars. Then the answer would be zero.

But the problem states the total is 58. That doesn't add up. Wait, maybe I misunderstood. Let me read again.\n\nOh, wait, the problem says: \"There are 58 students in the school with each classroom having the same number of students.\" So the total number of students is 58, and each classroom has the same number.

The problem is about a school field trip. They have 87 classrooms, and each classroom has the same number of students. The total number of students in the school is 58. Wait, that seems a bit odd. If there are 87 classrooms and 58 students total, that means each classroom can't have more than one student, right? Because 87 classrooms times any number of students per classroom would have to equal 58. Let me check that. Let's say each classroom has 'x' students. Then 87 * x = 58. Solving for x, x = 58 / 87. That's approximately 0.6667. So each classroom has a fraction of a student. That doesn't make much sense. Wait, maybe I misunderstood the problem. Let me read again.\n\nThe school has 87 classrooms. There are 58 students in the school with each classroom having the same number of students. If there are 2 seats on each school bus. How many buses are needed to take the trip?\n\nHmm, maybe the total number of students is 58, not each classroom. So total students is 58, divided into 87 classrooms. So each classroom has 58 / 87 students. That's approximately 0.6667 students per classroom. But that's not possible. So maybe the problem has a mistake. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Let me check the problem again.\n\nThe problem says: \"There are 58 students in the school with each classroom having the same number of students.\" So total students is 58. So each classroom has 58 / 87 students. Which is approximately 0.6667. But that's not a whole number. So that's impossible. So maybe the problem has a typo. Alternatively, maybe the total number of students is 87, not 58. Let me check that. If total students is 87, then each classroom has 1 student. That would make sense. But the problem states 58 students. So perhaps there's a mistake in the problem. But assuming the problem is correct as stated, then each classroom has 58/87 students, which is approximately 0.6667. But that's not possible. So maybe the problem is wrong. Alternatively, maybe I misread it. Let me read again.\n\nWait, maybe the total number of students is 87, not 58. That would make more sense. If each classroom has the same number of students, then 87 students divided by 87 classrooms is 1 student per classroom. Then the number of buses needed would be total students divided by seats per bus. So 87 / 2 = 43.5. So 44 buses. But the problem states 58 students. So that's conflicting.

Because he had 24 more than Doug. That makes sense.\n\nNow, Doug lost 27 marbles. So Doug's new number of marbles would be D - 27. And Ed found 9 more marbles.

Let me read it again.\n\n\"If the cave is 919 feet deep and they need to travel 1307 feet How far is the end of the cave?\"\n\nHmm, the wording is a bit confusing. Let me break it down. The cave's depth is 919 feet. So the cave goes down that deep. But then they need to travel 1307 feet. Wait, maybe the total distance they have to travel is 1307 feet, which includes the depth of the cave plus some extra? Or maybe the cave is 919 feet deep, and they need to travel 1307 feet to reach the end. But that doesn't make sense because 1307 is more than 919. So maybe the cave is 919 feet deep, and they need to travel an additional distance to reach the end. But the question is a bit unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the cave is 919 feet deep, and they need to travel 1307 feet in total. So the end of the cave would be 1307 feet from the starting point. But that seems straightforward. Wait, but the cave's depth is 919 feet. So if the cave is 919 feet deep, then the end of the cave is at that depth. So the total distance to the end would be 919 feet. But the problem says they need to travel 1307 feet. So maybe there's a mistake in the problem statement. Alternatively, maybe the cave is 919 feet deep, and the distance to the end is 1307 feet. But that would mean they have to go way beyond the cave's depth. That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the cave is 919 feet deep, and the distance to the end is 1307 feet. But that would mean the cave extends beyond its depth. That's possible if the cave has a horizontal component. But the problem doesn't mention that. So maybe the question is missing some information. Alternatively, maybe the question is phrased incorrectly. Let me try to parse it again.\n\nThe original question: \"If the cave is 919 feet deep and they need to travel 1307 feet How far is the end of the cave?\" Hmm. Maybe the cave is 919 feet deep, and they need to travel 1307 feet to reach the end. So the end of the cave is 1307 feet away. But that would mean the cave is longer than its depth. But maybe the cave has a horizontal component. For example, if the cave goes down 919 feet vertically, but the total distance to the end is 1307 feet. Then the horizontal distance would be sqrt(1307^2 - 919^2). But that's getting into Pythagorean theorem. But the problem doesn't mention any horizontal distance. So perhaps the question is simply asking how far the end of the cave is, given that the cave is 919 feet deep and they need to travel 1307 feet. But that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the cave is 919 feet deep, and the distance to the end is 1307 feet. So the answer would be 1307 feet. But that seems straightforward. Wait, but maybe the question is a trick question. Like, the cave is 919 feet deep, so the end is at 919 feet. But they need to travel 1307 feet. So the answer is 1307. But that seems simple. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking how far the end of the cave is from the starting point, which would be 1307 feet. So the answer is 1307. But I'm not sure. The problem statement is a bit ambiguous. Let me think again. The cave's depth is 919 feet. So the vertical distance is 919. But the total distance to travel is 1307. So perhaps the cave has a slope. So the actual distance traveled would be the hypotenuse. But without knowing the angle or the horizontal distance, we can't compute that. But the problem doesn't provide that information. So maybe the question is simply asking for the total distance to travel, which is 1307 feet. So the answer is 1307. But that seems straightforward. Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick and the answer is 919. But that would only make sense if the total distance to travel is the depth of the cave. But the problem says they need to travel 1307 feet. So perhaps the answer is 1307. So I think the answer is 1307.\n</LONG_COT>\n<ANSWER>\n1307\n</ANSWER>", "answer": "1307", "is_correct": false, "token_count": 1106}}

Steven has 4502 skittles and 4276 erasers. He wants to organize them into 154 groups. The question is asking how big each group is. Hmm, so I need to find the total number of items and then divide by the number of groups.\n\nFirst, I should add the skittles and erasers together. Let me do that. 4502 plus 4276. Let's add the thousands first: 4000 + 4000 = 8000. Then the hundreds: 500 + 200 = 700. The tens: 0 + 70 = 70. The units: 2 + 6 = 8. So adding them all together: 8000 + 700 + 70 + 8 = 8778.

Hmm, I need to find the difference between the number of children who got off and those who got on.\n\nLet me break it down step by step. Initially, there are 36 children. Then 68 got off. So after that, the number of children on the bus would be 36 - 68. But wait, 36 minus 68 is a negative number. That doesn't make sense. Oh, wait, maybe I made a mistake. Wait, no, that's possible.

So let me think again.\n\nLet me denote the number of children who got on as x. So after 68 got off, the number of children left on the bus is 36 - 68. Then x children got on, so the total becomes (36 - 68) + x = 12. Let me write that equation:\n\n36 - 68 + x = 12\n\nSimplify the left side: 36 - 68 is -32.

Let me do that multiplication. 68 times 16. Hmm, 60*16=960, and 8*16=128. So 960+128=1088. So the total should be 1088 pieces.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Alternative way: 16*4=64 per block, then 64*17. Wait, no, that's not the same. Wait, no. Let me think. Alternatively, total houses is 17*16=272 houses. Then each house gets 4, so 272*4. Let's compute that. 272*4: 200*4=800, 70*4=280, 2*4=8. So 800+280=1080, +8=1088. Yep, same answer. So that confirms it.

The problem says that David did 56 more push-ups than Zachary. David did 38 push-ups. I need to find out how many they did altogether. Hmm, wait, that doesn't quite add up. If David did 38, which is more than Zachary, then Zachary must have done fewer. But the difference is 56. That seems a bit conflicting. Let me read the problem again.\n\n\"Oh, wait, maybe I misunderstood. Let me check. The problem states: David did 56 more push-ups than Zachary. If David did 38 push-ups, how many did Zachary and David do altogether? Wait, that can't be. If David did 38, which is more than Zachary, then the difference is 56. So Zachary must have done 38 minus 56. But 38 minus 56 is negative. That doesn't make sense. Oh, wait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me read again.\n\nAh, maybe the problem says David did 56 more than Zachary. So David's push-ups = Zachary's push-ups + 56. But if David did 38, then Zachary must have done 38 - 56. Which is -18. That's impossible. So there's a mistake here. Wait, maybe the numbers are mixed up. Let me check the problem again.\n\nThe problem says: David did 56 more push-ups than Zachary. If David did 38 push-ups, how many did they do altogether? Wait, that's impossible. Because if David did 38, which is more than Zachary, the difference is 56. So Zachary would have done 38 -56 = -18. That's not possible. So there must be a mistake in the problem. Alternatively, maybe I misunderstood the problem. Let me read again.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem says Zachary did 56 more than David. That would make more sense. But the problem states \"David did 56 more than Zachary.\" So that's the given. So maybe the numbers are incorrect. But assuming the problem is correct as stated, then the answer would be negative, which is impossible. So perhaps there's a mistake in the problem. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is correct, and the answer is negative. But that's not a valid scenario. So maybe the numbers are swapped. Let me think. Alternatively, maybe the problem says Zachary did 56 more than David. Then Zachary would have done 38 +56 = 94. Then total would be 38 +94 = 132. But the problem states David did 56 more than Zachary. So that's not the case. So perhaps the problem has a typo. But assuming the problem is correct as stated, then the answer would be impossible. But since the problem is presented, maybe there's a miscalculation. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I misunderstood the problem. Let me rephrase. If David did 56 more than Zachary, and David did 38, then Zachary did 38 -56 = -18. That's not possible. So perhaps the problem should say Zachary did 56 more than David. Then Zachary would have done 38 +56 =94. Total would be 38+94=132. But the problem states David did 56 more. So that's not the case. So perhaps the problem is incorrect. But maybe the numbers are different. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem says David did 56 fewer than Zachary. But that would be the opposite. Let me check. If David did 56 fewer than Zachary, then Zachary did 38 +56 =94. Total would be 38+94=132. But the problem says David did 56 more. So that's not the case. So perhaps the problem is incorrect. But since the user presented it, maybe there's a mistake in the problem. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to assume that the problem is correct and proceed. So perhaps the answer is -18 for Zachary, but that's not possible. So maybe the problem has a typo. But since the user wants an answer, perhaps I should proceed with the given numbers. So maybe the problem should say Zachary did 56 fewer than David. Then Zachary would have done 38-56 = -18. But that's not possible. So perhaps the problem is incorrect. Alternatively, maybe the numbers are reversed. Let me think. If David did 38, which is 56 less than Zachary, then Zachary did 38 +56 =94. Total 132. But the problem says David did 56 more. So that's not the case. So perhaps the problem is incorrect. But since the user wants an answer, maybe I should proceed. So perhaps the answer is 38 + (38-56) = 38 + (-18) = 20. But that's not possible. So perhaps the problem has a mistake. But maybe the numbers are different. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again. Wait, the problem says David did 56 more than Zachary. So David = Zachary +56. So Zachary = David -56. So if David did 38, then Zachary did 38-56 = -18. Which is impossible. So the problem is incorrect. But perhaps the numbers are swapped. If the problem said Zachary did 56 more than David, then Zachary would have done 38+56=94. Total 38+94=132. But the problem states David did 56 more. So perhaps the problem is incorrect. But since the user presented it, I need to proceed. So the answer would be 38 + (38-56) = 38 + (-18) = 20. But that's not possible. So maybe the problem is a trick question. But I think there's a mistake. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. Wait, perhaps the problem says David did 56 more than Zachary, but the numbers are such that Zachary did 38, and David did 38+56=94. Then total would be 38+94=132. But that's only if the problem said Zachary did 56 fewer. But the problem says David did 56 more. So that's not the case. So perhaps the problem is incorrect.

So Dan has $2, and he bought some candy bars. Each candy bar costs $6, but wait, the problem says each one costing $3. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me read it again.\n\nOh, maybe there's a mistake in the wording. Let me check. The problem says: \"Dan has $2. He bought some candy bar for $6 each one costing $3.\" Hmm, that doesn't make much sense. Wait, maybe it's a typo. Let me think. Maybe the cost per candy bar is $3, not $6. Because if each costs $6, he can't buy any with $2. So maybe the correct interpretation is that each candy bar costs $3. Let me assume that.\n\nSo if each candy bar costs $3, then how many can he buy with $2? Well, $2 divided by $3 per candy bar. That would be 2/3, which is approximately 0.6667. But you can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, so he can't buy any. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me read again.\n\nThe problem says: \"Dan has $2. He bought some candy bar for $6 each one costing $3.\" Hmm, that's confusing. Maybe it's a translation issue. Let me try to parse it again. \"He bought some candy bar for $6 each one costing $3.\" Wait, that phrase is a bit ambiguous. Maybe it's saying that each candy bar costs $3, but he bought them for $6 each. That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the problem has a mistake. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem meant that each candy bar costs $3, and he bought some. Then with $2, he can buy 0 candy bars. But that seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the problem has a typo. Let me check the numbers again. The user might have meant that each candy bar costs $0.30 or something. But the numbers given are $2, $6, and $3. Let me try again.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is correct as is. Let me assume that each candy bar costs $3. Then with $2, he can't buy any. But the question asks how many he bought. So perhaps there's a mistake in the problem. Alternatively, maybe I misunderstood. Let me read the problem again.\n\n\"Dan has $2. He bought some candy bar for $6 each one costing $3.\" Hmm, maybe the wording is \"for $6 each, one costing $3.\" That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe it's a trick question. Wait, maybe the total cost is $6, and each costs $3. So total number would be 6/3=2. But that would imply he spent $6, which he doesn't have. So that's impossible. So perhaps the problem is incorrect. Alternatively, maybe the problem is correct, and the answer is zero. But the question asks how many he bought. So the answer would be zero. But that seems unlikely. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem says he bought some candy bars, each costing $3, and the total cost was $6. But that would mean he bought 2 candy bars. But he only has $2. So that's impossible. So perhaps the problem is wrong. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the numbers. Let me assume that the correct numbers are such that he can buy some. For example, if each candy bar costs $1, then with $2 he can buy 2. But the problem says $3 each. So maybe the problem is a trick question. The answer is zero. But the question says \"how many candy bar did he buy?\" So the answer is 0. But let me check again.

So Dan has $2, and he bought some candy bars. Each candy bar costs $6, but then there's this part that says each one costing $3. Wait, that might be a mistake. Let me read it again.\n\nThe problem says: Dan has $2. He bought some candy bars for $6 each one costing $3. How many candy bars did he buy? Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Let me break it down. \n\nFirst, the total amount Dan has is $2. Each candy bar costs $6. But then it says \"each one costing $3.\" That part doesn't make sense. Maybe there's a typo. Let me think. If each candy bar costs $6, then how can he buy any with only $2? That would be impossible. Wait, but maybe the problem meant something else. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is saying that each candy bar costs $6, but he bought them at a discount where each one costs $3. That would make sense. So the original price is $6, but he paid $3 per candy bar. Then, with $2, how many can he buy? Let's see. If each costs $3, then $2 divided by $3 per candy bar. So 2 divided by 3 is approximately 0.666... So he can't buy a fraction of a candy bar. So that would mean he can buy 0 candy bars. But that seems odd. Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the problem. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem says he bought some candy bars for $6 each, and each one costing $3. That phrasing is a bit unclear. Maybe it's a mistake. Let me assume that the correct interpretation is that each candy bar costs $3. Then, with $2, he can buy 2/3 of a candy bar, which again doesn't make sense. So perhaps the problem has a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the total cost is $6 for multiple candy bars. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is saying that he bought some candy bars, each costing $6, but the total cost was $3. That would mean he bought 3/6 = 0.5 candy bars. That's impossible. So perhaps the problem is incorrect. Alternatively, maybe the problem meant that each candy bar costs $3, not $6. Let me try that. If each costs $3, then with $2, he can buy 2/3 of a candy bar. But that's not possible. So maybe the problem is wrong. Alternatively, maybe there's a miscalculation. Let me read the problem again.\n\nThe problem states: Dan has $2. He bought some candy bars for $6 each one costing $3. How many candy bars did he buy? Wait, the wording is a bit unclear. Maybe it's saying that each candy bar costs $6, but the total cost was $3. That would mean he bought 3/6 = 0.5 candy bars. Again, impossible. So perhaps the problem has a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the total cost is $6, and each candy bar costs $3. That would mean he bought 6/3 = 2 candy bars. But then he only has $2, so that's impossible. So maybe the problem is incorrect. Alternatively, maybe the problem meant that each candy bar costs $2, and he bought some for $3 each. That would also not work. Alternatively, maybe the problem is in another currency. But I don't think so. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is correct, and the answer is zero. Because with $2, you can't buy any candy bars at $6 each. So the answer would be 0. But let me check again. If each candy bar costs $3, then with $2, he can buy 0.666..., so 0. But if each costs $6, then 0. So the answer is 0. But the problem says \"some candy bars\", which implies at least one. So maybe there's a mistake in the problem. Alternatively, maybe the problem is correct, and the answer is zero.

Hmm, so I need to find the number of weeks based on the total amount he earned and his weekly rate.\n\nWait, so the total amount is the product of the weekly earnings and the number of weeks. Right? So the formula would be Total = Weekly Earnings \u00d7 Number of Weeks. So if I plug in the numbers, it would be 1216 = 16 \u00d7 Weeks. So to find the number of weeks, I need to divide the total by the weekly amount. Let me check that.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So Weeks = Total / Weekly Earnings. So 1216 divided by 16. Let me do that calculation. Let's see, 16 times 70 is 1120. So 1216 minus 1120 is 96. Then 16 times 6 is 96. So 70 + 6 = 76. So 1216 divided by 16 is 76. So the harvest lasted 76 weeks. Wait, that seems like a long time for a harvest. But maybe that's correct depending on the context. Let me double-check. 16 times 76. 16\u00d770=1120, 16\u00d76=96. 1120+96=1216. Yep, that's correct.

That makes sense.\n\nNow, Ed lost 17 marbles. So instead of having D + 29, he now has (D + 29) - 17. Let me simplify that. D + 29 minus 17 is D + 12. So Ed now has D + 12 marbles.\n\nDoug still has D marbles, right? Because the problem doesn't say anything about Doug losing any marbles. So Doug's count remains the same. \n\nThe question is asking how many more marbles Ed has than Doug now. So we need to subtract Doug's marbles from Ed's current count. That would be (D + 12) - D. Simplifying that, it's 12. So Ed has 12 more marbles than Doug now. \n\nWait, let me check that again. If Doug has D, Ed originally had D +29. After losing 17, Ed has D +12.

The problem says we ordered some pizzas, and each pizza has 2 slices. The total number of slices is 28. I need to find out how many pizzas we ordered. Hmm, alright, let me think.\n\nSo, each pizza has 2 slices. If I have one pizza, that's 2 slices. If I have two pizzas, that's 4 slices. So the number of slices is twice the number of pizzas. Right? Because each pizza contributes 2 slices. So the total slices = number of pizzas \u00d7 2. \n\nThe total slices here are 28. So I can set up an equation. Let's let the number of pizzas be 'p'. Then, 2 \u00d7 p = 28. To find p, I divide both sides by 2. So p = 28 \u00f7 2. That equals 14. So we ordered 14 pizzas. Let me check that.

Hmm, right.\n\nSo the total number of kids is 898,051. If 629,424 go to camp, then the number that stay home should be the total minus the ones who went to camp. That makes sense. So I need to subtract 629,424 from 898,051. Let me check that again. Yeah, total minus the ones who left gives the ones who stayed.

Borrow 1 from the 8, making it 7, and the 0 becomes 10. 10 - 2 = 8. So the next digit is 8.\n\nNext digit: 8 - 9. Wait, 8 is less than 9. So borrow again. The next digit is 9. Borrow 1 from the 9, making it 8, and the 8 becomes 18. 18 - 9 = 9. So the next digit is 9.\n\nThen the next digit: 9 - 2. That's 7. So the next digit is 7.\n\nFinally, the leftmost digit: 8 - 6 = 2. So the leftmost digit is 2.\n\nPutting it all together: 268627. Let me check that. 629,424 plus 268,627 should equal 898,051.

So the number she cut must be the difference between the current and original counts. So for orchids, it's 7 - 3 = 4. So she cut 4 orchids. Let me check the roses. Original was 16, now 13. So 13 -16 = -3. Wait, that would mean she removed 3 roses, but the problem says she cut some more. Oh, wait, the problem says \"cut some more roses and orchids from her flower garden.\" So she took some from the garden and added them to the vase. So the total number of each type in the vase increased. So the number she added is the difference. So for roses, 13 -16 = -3. That doesn't make sense. Wait, no, that can't be. That would mean she removed 3 roses, which contradicts the problem statement. Wait, the problem says she cut some more roses and orchids. So she took some from the garden and added them to the vase. So the total number of each type in the vase should be the original plus the ones she added. So for roses: original 16, now 13. So 13 -16 = -3. That would imply she removed 3 roses, which contradicts the problem. Wait, that's a problem. Let me read the problem again.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"There were 16 roses and 3 orchids in the vase. Jessica cut some more roses and orchids from her flower garden. There are now 7 orchids and 13 roses in the vase. How many orchids did she cut?\"\n\nWait, the initial number of roses was 16, now it's 13. So that's a decrease. So she must have removed 3 roses. But the problem says she cut some more roses and orchids. So that suggests she added them. So there's a contradiction here. Wait, maybe the problem is phrased incorrectly. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"Jessica cut some more roses and orchids from her flower garden.\" So she took some from the garden and added them to the vase. So the total number of each type in the vase should increase. But for roses, it decreased from 16 to 13. So that's a decrease. So that's impossible unless she removed some. But the problem says she cut some more, which implies adding. So perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement. Alternatively, maybe I misunderstood. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is correct, and the numbers are as given. So perhaps the original number was 16 roses and 3 orchids. After adding some, there are 13 roses and 7 orchids. So the number of roses decreased by 3, and the number of orchids increased by 4. So the question is asking how many orchids she cut. But if she cut orchids, that would mean she removed them. But the number of orchids increased. So that's a contradiction. So maybe the problem has a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the problem means that she took some from the garden and added them to the vase. So the number she added is the difference. So for orchids, 7-3=4. So she added 4 orchids. For roses, 13-16=-3. So she removed 3 roses. But the problem says she cut some more roses and orchids. So \"cut\" here means taking from the garden and adding to the vase. So the orchids she added are 4. So the answer is 4. But the roses decreased, which contradicts the problem. So perhaps the problem has a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the initial numbers are different. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"There were 16 roses and 3 orchids in the vase. Jessica cut some more roses and orchids from her flower garden. There are now 7 orchids and 13 roses in the vase. How many orchids did she cut?\"\n\nSo the initial numbers are 16 roses and 3 orchids. After adding some, it's 13 roses and 7 orchids. So the number of roses decreased by 3, and the number of orchids increased by 4. So the question is asking how many orchids she cut. But if she cut orchids, that would mean she removed them. But the number of orchids increased. So that's a contradiction. Therefore, perhaps the problem is incorrect, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, maybe the problem is correct, and the answer is 4. But the roses decreased, which contradicts the statement that she cut some more. So maybe the problem has a mistake. But assuming the problem is correct, the answer would be 4. So I'll go with that.\n</LONG_COT>\n<ANSWER>\n4\n</ANSWER>", "answer": "4", "is_correct": true, "token_count": 1261}}

Now, the question is asking how many more trees survived than those that died. So I need to compare the number of survivors to the number that died.\n\nThe number that died is 6.

Let me read the question again to make sure I understand.\n\nThe problem says: There are 8 different books and 10 different movies in the 'crazy silly school' series. If you read 19 of the books and watched 61 of the movies, how many more movies than books are there in the series? Hmm, wait, that's a bit odd.

So the equation would be:\n\nEd's marbles = Doug's marbles + 19\n\nSubstituting the values we have:\n\nD + 2 = (D - L) + 19\n\nNow, let's simplify this equation. Subtract D from both sides:\n\n2 = -L + 19\n\nThen, add L to both sides:\n\n2 + L = 19\n\nSubtract 2 from both sides:\n\nL = 19 - 2\n\nL = 17\n\nSo Doug lost 17 marbles. Let me check that. If Doug originally had D marbles, then after losing 17, he has D - 17. Ed had D + 2 originally, so now he still has D + 2. The difference is (D + 2) - (D - 17) = 19. Yep, that works. So the answer should be 17.\n</LONG_COT>\n<ANSWER>\n17\n</ANSWER>", "answer": "17", "is_correct": true, "token_count": 397}}

The problem says that Jake has 13 fewer peaches and 3 more apples than Steven. Steven has 9 peaches and 8 apples. I need to find out how many apples Jake has.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many peaches Jake has. Since Steven has 9 peaches and Jake has 13 fewer, I subtract 13 from Steven's peaches. So, 9 minus 13. Wait, that would be negative 4. But wait, that doesn't make sense. Oh, wait, maybe I misunderstood. Let me read again.\n\nJake has 13 fewer peaches than Steven. Steven has 9 peaches. So Jake's peaches = Steven's peaches - 13. So 9 -13 = -4. But you can't have negative peaches. That must mean there's a mistake in my understanding. Wait, no, the problem might be stating that Jake has fewer peaches, so the number is lower. But negative numbers don't make sense here. Hmm, maybe the problem has a mistake, or maybe I'm misunderstanding.

That might imply that the problem has an error, but maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the problem is correct, and the answer is negative, but that's unlikely. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is a trick question. But the question asks for the number of apples Jake has. Let's focus on the apples. The problem says Jake has 3 more apples than Steven. Steven has 8 apples. So Jake's apples = 8 +3 = 11. So the answer would be 11. But wait, the peaches part seems conflicting.
