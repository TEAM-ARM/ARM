The problem says there are 41 bird families near the mountain. Some flew to Asia and some to Africa. Specifically, 35 families went to Asia and 62 went to Africa. The question is asking how many more families went to Africa than Asia. \n\nHmm, so I need to find the difference between the number of families that went to Africa and those that went to Asia. That would be 62 minus 35. Let me calculate that. 62 minus 35 is 27. So, 27 more families went to Africa than Asia. \n\nWait, let me double-check the numbers. The total number of families is 41. If 35 went to Asia and 62 to Africa, adding those together: 35 + 62 = 97. But there are only 41 families in total. That doesn't add up. Oh, wait, something's wrong here. Because 35 plus 62 is 97, which is more than 41. That means there's a mistake in the problem statement. But assuming the numbers given are correct, even if the total is wrong, the question asks for the difference. \n\nSo even if the total is wrong, the difference is 62 - 35 = 27. So the answer should be 27. Even though the total isn't matching, the question only asks for the difference.

We need to find out how many more marbles Ed had than Doug then.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. First, let's find out how many marbles Doug had initially. If Ed had 10 more than Doug, and Ed has 45, then Doug must have had 45 minus 10. That would be 35 marbles. Wait, let me check that. If Ed has 45, and that's 10 more than Doug, then Doug has 45 - 10 = 35. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nThen, Doug lost 11 marbles. So we need to subtract 11 from Doug's original number of marbles.

The problem is about calculating the total number of oranges harvested over 87 days. The information given is that they harvest 66 sacks per day, and each sack contains 25 oranges. So, I need to find the total oranges after 87 days.\n\nHmm, right. So, the approach here is to first find out how many oranges are harvested in one day, and then multiply that by the number of days. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate the number of oranges per day. If they harvest 66 sacks per day and each sack has 25 oranges, then per day it's 66 sacks * 25 oranges/sack. Let me do that multiplication. 66 times 25. Let's see, 60 times 25 is 1500, and 6 times 25 is 150. So 1500 + 150 = 1650. So each day, they harvest 1650 oranges.\n\nNow, to find the total for 87 days, I multiply the daily amount by 87. So 1650 * 87. Let me calculate that. Hmm, 1650 * 80 is 132,000 and 1650 * 7 is 11,550. Adding those together: 132,000 + 11,550 = 143,550. So the total number of oranges after 87 days is 143,550.\n\nWait, let me double-check the multiplication. 66 * 25. Another way to do that is 66 * 25 = 66 * (20 + 5) = 66*20 + 66*5 = 1320 + 330 = 1650. Yes, that's correct. Then 1650 * 87. Let me compute that again. 1650 * 80 = 132,000. 1650 * 7 = 11,550. 132,000 + 11,550 = 143,550. That seems right.

But the problem might expect the exact fractional part, which is 17 and 2/3 minutes, but typically, such problems expect the answer in whole minutes.

The problem is about Bryan's books and magazines. He has 9 books on each of his 10 bookshelves. And he wants to know the total number of magazines. Hmm, wait, the question says \"How many magazines does he have in total?\" So I need to figure out the total number of magazines, not books.\n\nLet me break it down. He has 10 bookshelves. Each shelf has 9 books. So first, I should calculate the total number of books. That would be 10 bookshelves times 9 books per shelf. So 10 multiplied by 9 is 90.

The problem is about a cave that's 1218 feet deep. They're already at 849 feet. They're traveling at a speed of 17 feet per unit time. The question is asking how much farther they need to go until they reach the end.\n\nHmm, so first, I need to find out how much farther is the end. That would be the total depth minus their current position. So 1218 feet minus 849 feet. Let me calculate that. 1218 - 849. Let's do the subtraction. 1218 minus 800 is 418, then minus 49 more is 369. So the remaining distance is 369 feet.\n\nNow, the question is how much time it'll take to cover that distance at a speed of 17 feet per unit time. Time is equal to distance divided by speed.

So the time is 22 and 5/17 of a unit time. But the problem says \"speed of 17,\" so maybe the unit time is a certain unit. The question probably expects the answer in feet, not time.

Wait, the problem says each group has 2 eggs. So total eggs = number of groups * eggs per group. Number of groups is 11. So 11 * 2 = 22. Yes, that's correct. So the answer is 22.\n</LONG_COT>\n<ANSWER>\n22\n</ANSWER>", "answer": "22", "is_correct": true, "token_count": 419}}

The problem is about the number of kids going to camp and those staying home during summer break. Oh, right, we need to find out how many more kids stayed home compared to those who went to the camp. \n\nSo, the numbers given are 202958 kids went to camp and 777622 stayed home. The question is asking for the difference between the two numbers. Hmm, right. So I think I just subtract the number of kids who went to camp from the number who stayed home. Let me write that down to make sure.\n\nThe formula would be: Number of kids who stayed home - Number of kids who went to camp. That's 777622 minus 202958. Let me do that calculation. \n\nLet me subtract 202958 from 777622. To make it easier, I can do 777622 - 202958. Let's break it down. Maybe splitting the numbers: 777622 - 200000 = 577622. Then subtract 2958 more: 577622 - 2958. Let's calculate that. 577622 minus 2000 is 575622, then minus 958 is 574664. Wait, maybe there's a better way. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, subtracting the smaller number from the larger one: 777622 - 202958. Let's do it step by step. \n\n777622\n- 202958\n= (777622 - 200000) - 2958\n= 577622 - 2958\n= 574664. \n\nWait, that seems right. So the difference is 574664. So 574,664 more kids stayed home compared to those who went to camp. Let me double-check the subtraction. \n\nAnother way: 777622 - 202958. Let's align the numbers:\n\n777622\n- 202958\n= 574664.

The problem is about a baker who made some cakes, sold some, and then made more. I need to find out how many more cakes he made than those he sold. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the baker made 144 cakes. Then he sold 71 of them. So I should subtract the number of cakes sold from the number he made initially. That part is 144 minus 71. Let me calculate that. 144 minus 70 is 74, and then minus 1 more is 73. So he has 73 cakes left after selling 71.\n\nNext, the baker made 111 more cakes. So I need to add those 111 to the 73 cakes he has left. 73 plus 111. Let's do that. 70 + 110 is 180, and then +11 more is 191. So he now has 191 cakes.\n\nThe question asks how many more cakes he made than those he sold. He made 144 cakes and sold 71. So subtract the sold ones from the made ones: 144 - 71.

The problem is about Lawrence County having 313,473 kids. During summer break, 274,865 stay home, and the rest go to camp. I need to find out how many go to camp.\n\nSo, the total number of kids is 313,473. Subtract the number who stay home, which is 274,865. That should give the number going to camp. Let me do the subtraction step by step to make sure I don't make a mistake.\n\nHmm, subtracting 274,865 from 313,473. Let's write that out: 313,473 - 274,865. To make it easier, I can align the numbers by place value.\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n313,473\n- 274,865\nLet me subtract digit by digit.\n\nFirst, subtract the thousands place: 473 (from the first number) minus 865 (from the second number). Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, the numbers are in thousands. Wait, maybe I should approach it differently. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to subtract 274,865 from 313,473. Let's do it the standard way:\n\n313,473\n- 274,865\nLet's subtract the numbers column by column.\n\nStarting from the right:\n3 - 5. Can't do that, so borrow 1 from the thousands place. That makes it 13 - 5 = 8.\nThen the thousands place: 3 (after borrowing) - 6. Again, can't do that, so borrow from the hundred thousands place. Wait, maybe I should split the numbers.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to subtract 274,865 from 313,473. Let's do it step by step:\n\n313,473\n- 274,865\n= (313,473 - 274,865)\n\nLet's subtract the thousands place first. 473 - 865. Hmm, that's negative. Wait, maybe I should break it down:\n\n313,473\n- 274,865\n= (313,473 - 200,000) - (74,865 - 200,000) ? Wait, maybe not the best approach. Let's do it digit by digit.\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n3 (ones place): 3 - 5. Can't do that, so borrow 1 from the tens place. But wait, the tens place is 7. Let's see. Let's write it out:\n\n313,473\n- 274,865\n= 313,473 - 274,865\n\nLet me subtract digit by digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n3 - 5. Can't do that, so borrow 1 from the tens place (which is 7). So the tens place becomes 6, and the ones place becomes 13. Then 13 - 5 = 8.\n\nNext, the hundreds place: 6 (after borrowing) - 6. 6 - 6 = 0.\n\nThen the thousands place: 4 (after borrowing) - 8. Can't do that, so borrow from the ten thousands place. The ten thousands place is 3, so it becomes 2. Then 14 (after borrowing) - 8 = 6.\n\nThen the ten thousands place: 2 (after borrowing) - 4. 2 - 4 = -2. Need to borrow from the hundred thousands place. The hundred thousands place is 3, so it becomes 2. Then 12 - 4 = 8.\n\nThen the hundred thousands place: 2 - 2 = 0.\n\nSo putting it all together: 8 (ones) 0 (tens) 6 (hundreds) 8 (thousands) 2 (ten thousands) 0 (hundred thousands).\n\nWait, that seems complicated. Let me check again.\n\nWait, let's do the subtraction step by step:\n\n313,473\n- 274,865\n\nStart from the right:\n\n3 - 5. Can't do that, so borrow 1 from the next digit. That becomes 13 - 5 = 8.\n\nThen the next digit: 7 (after borrowing) - 6 = 1.\n\nNext, 4 (after borrowing) - 8. Can't do that, so borrow from the next digit. That becomes 3 (after borrowing) - 8. Still can't do that, so borrow from the next digit. 2 (after borrowing) - 8 = -6. Need to borrow from the next digit. Wait, that's getting complicated. Let me try another approach.\n\nAlternatively, subtract 274,865 from 313,473.\n\nLet's subtract 200,000 first: 313,473 - 200,000 = 113,473.\n\nThen subtract 74,865: 113,473 - 74,865.\n\nNow, 113,473 - 74,865.\n\nSubtract 70,000: 113,473 - 70,000 = 43,473.\n\nThen subtract 4,865: 43,473 - 4,865.\n\nSubtract 4,000: 43,473 - 4,000 = 39,473.\n\nThen subtract 865: 39,473 - 865 = 38,608.\n\nWait, that seems to give 38,608. Let me verify that calculation.\n\nOriginal numbers:\n\n313,473 - 274,865 = 38,608.\n\nYes, that seems right. Let me check again.\n\nAnother way: 313,473 minus 274,865. Let's compute 313,473 - 274,865.\n\nLet's subtract 274,865 from 313,473. The result should be 38,608. Because if you subtract 200,000 from 313,473, you get 113,473. Then subtract 74,865: 113,473 - 74,865 = 38,608.

Then, subtract the number given away from the number eaten to find the difference. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nHe started with 17 cookies. He ate 14. So the number of cookies left after eating would be 17 minus 14. Let me calculate that. 17 - 14 = 3. So he has 3 cookies left after eating.\n\nThen, he gave 13 cookies to his friend. So the number of cookies he has now is 3 (after eating) minus 13 (given away). Wait, that can't be right. Because if he had 3 left after eating 14, and then gave 13 away, he would have 3 - 13 = -10. That doesn't make sense. Oh, wait, no. Wait, the problem says he ate 14 and gave 13. So the total cookies he consumed (eaten and given) is 14 + 13 = 27. But he only had 17 to start with. So he couldn't have eaten 14 and given 13 if he only had 17. That suggests there's a mistake in the problem's numbers.

But wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"He ate 14 cookies and gave 13 of them to his friend.\" So he ate 14 and gave 13. The question is how many more cookies he ate than those he gave. So 14 - 13 = 1. So the answer is 1. Hmm. But wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recheck the numbers. \n\nHe started with 17. Ate 14, so 17 - 14 = 3 left. Then gave 13. So 3 - 13 = -10. That's negative. That doesn't make sense. Oh, wait, the problem says he gave 13 to his friend. So he gave away 13 cookies, which is more than he had left (3). That's impossible. So there's a mistake here. But the problem is given as is. So maybe I need to interpret it as he ate 14 and gave away 13, so the total given is 13, and eaten is 14. The question is how many more he ate than gave. So 14 - 13 = 1. So the answer is 1.

The problem says Jessie currently weighs 27 kilograms after starting to jog. She lost 101 kilograms after starting. The question is, how much did she weigh before starting to jog?\n\nHmm, so if she lost 101 kilograms after starting, that means her weight before jogging was her current weight plus the weight she lost. Oh right, because weight loss reduces your weight. So if she is now 27 kg, that means she was 27 kg plus 101 kg before she started jogging.

The problem is about Nell and Jeff's baseball cards. Nell originally had 566 cards, and Jeff had 234. She gave some of her cards to Jeff, and now she has 535 left. We need to find out how many cards Jeff has now.\n\nHmm, right. So, let's break this down. Nell gave some cards to Jeff. Let's call the number of cards she gave away as \\( x \\). After giving away \\( x \\) cards, she has 535 left. So, the equation would be 566 minus \\( x \\) equals 535. Wait, wait, no. Wait, no. Wait, she gave some cards to Jeff. So, the number of cards Nell has now is her original minus the cards she gave away. And that equals 535. So, 566 - x = 535. Oh, right. So to find \\( x \\), we can subtract 535 from 566. Let me check that. 566 minus 535 is 31. So she gave 31 cards to Jeff. \n\nNow, Jeff originally had 234 cards. He received 31 cards from Nell. So the number of cards Jeff has now is 234 plus 31. Let's calculate that. 234 + 31 = 265. So Jeff now has 265 cards. \n\nWait, let me double-check. If Nell had 566 and gave 31 away, she has 535 left. Yes. And Jeff originally had 234, so 234 + 31 = 265. That seems right. So the answer should be 265.\n</LONG_COT>\n<ANSWER>\n265\n</ANSWER>", "answer": "265", "is_correct": true, "token_count": 416}}

The problem is about Nell collecting cards. She had 246 baseball cards and 214 Ace cards. Then she gave some cards to Jeff. Now, she has 404 baseball cards and 495 Ace cards left. The question is asking how many more Ace cards than baseball cards she has now.\n\nHmm, right. So first, I need to find out how many cards she gave to Jeff. Let's start with the baseball cards. She originally had 246 and now has 404. So the number given away is 404 minus 246. Let me calculate that. 404 minus 246 is 158. So she gave 158 baseball cards to Jeff.\n\nNow, for the Ace cards. She originally had 214 and now has 495. So the number given away is 495 minus 214. Let me do that. 495 minus 214. Let's see, 495 minus 200 is 295, then minus 14 more is 281. So she gave 281 Ace cards to Jeff.\n\nNow, the question is asking how many more Ace cards than baseball cards she has now. So we need to subtract the number of baseball cards from the number of Ace cards. That would be 495 (Ace) minus 404 (baseball). Let's calculate that. 495 minus 404 is 91. So she has 91 more Ace cards than baseball cards.\n\nWait, let me double-check the numbers to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Baseball cards: 246 to 404. 404 - 246 = 158. Correct. Ace cards: 214 to 495. 495 - 214 = 281. Correct. Then 495 - 404 = 91. Yes, that's right.

Out of this, 57 grams are for the colors, and he needs 22 grams more of wax. So, the total wax required would be the 57 grams plus the 22 grams. Let me calculate that. 57 + 22 = 79 grams.

{"question": "Frank was reading through his favorite book. The book had 2 chapters each with 405 pages. It took frank 664 days to finish the book. How many chapters did he read per day?", "data_source": "my_data/SVAMP", "ground_truth": "332", "adaptive": {"response": "<LONG_COT>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about Frank reading a book. The book has 2 chapters, each with 405 pages. He took 664 days to finish it. The question is asking how many chapters he read per day. Hmm, wait, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to find the total number of pages in the book. Since there are 2 chapters and each has 405 pages, I can calculate that by multiplying 2 by 405. Let me do that. 2 times 405 is 810. So the book has 810 pages in total.\n\nNext, the total time Frank took to finish the book is 664 days. The question is about how many chapters he read per day. Wait, but the book has 2 chapters. So if he took 664 days to read 810 pages, then the number of chapters he read per day would be the total chapters divided by the total days. Because the problem is asking for chapters per day. Wait, no, the question says \"how many chapters did he read per day?\" So that's chapters divided by days. So 2 chapters divided by 664 days. That would be 2/664. Let me compute that. 2 divided by 664 is the same as 1/332. But maybe there's a better way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should first find out how many pages he read per day. If the total pages are 810 and he took 664 days, then pages per day is 810 divided by 664. Let me calculate that. 810 divided by 664. Let's see, 664 times 1 is 664. 810 minus 664 is 146. 664 times 2 is 1328. 810 - 1328 is -518, which is negative. So that's not right. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me recheck the total pages. The book has 2 chapters, each 405 pages. So 2 * 405 = 810 pages. That's correct. And he took 664 days to read 810 pages. So pages per day is 810 / 664. Let's compute that. 810 divided by 664. Let's divide both by 2 first. That gives 405/332. Hmm, 405 divided by 332 is approximately 1.221. But the problem is probably expecting a whole number. Wait, maybe I should check if the problem is asking for chapters per day, not pages per day. The question says \"how many chapters did he read per day?\" So if he read 2 chapters in 664 days, then chapters per day is 2 / 664. Which is 1/332. But 1/332 is a fraction, which might not be what they expect. Let me read the question again.\n\n\"Frank was reading through his favorite book. The book had 2 chapters each with 405 pages. It took frank 664 days to finish the book. How many chapters did he read per day?\" Oh, wait, the question is about chapters per day. So the answer would be 2 chapters divided by 664 days, which is 2/664 = 1/332. But that's a fraction. Maybe the answer expects a whole number? That seems unlikely, but let me check the numbers again.\n\nTotal pages: 2 * 405 = 810. Total days: 664. Chapters per day: 2 / 664. Simplify that. 2 divided by 664 is the same as 1 divided by 332. So 1/332 chapters per day. That's approximately 0.00302. But the problem might expect a whole number, which it doesn't. So maybe there's a mistake in my approach. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nWait, the problem says \"how many chapters did he read per day?\" So if he read 2 chapters in 664 days, then per day it's 2/664 = 1/332. But maybe the answer is in whole chapters. Let me think again. Wait, perhaps the question is asking for pages per day, but the answer would be pages per day, not chapters. Let me check the question again. No, the question is about chapters per day. So the answer is 2 divided by 664. Which is 1/332. But 1/332 is a very small number. But maybe the answer expects a fraction. Wait, maybe I miscalculated the total pages. Let me recheck. 2 chapters, each 405 pages. 2 * 405 = 810. Correct. 664 days. So chapters per day is 2/664 = 1/332. So the answer is 1/332 chapters per day. But that's not a practical number. Maybe the question is expecting a whole number. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the problem setup. Let me read the problem again.\n\nThe book has 2 chapters, each with 405 pages. Total pages: 2 * 405 = 810. Time taken: 664 days. How many chapters per day. So chapters per day is 2 / 664. Which is 1/332. So the answer is 1/332 chapters per day. But the problem probably expects a whole number. Maybe I made a mistake in the problem statement. Let me check the question again. Oh, wait, maybe it's a trick question. The question says \"how many chapters did he read per day?\" So 2 chapters in 664 days is 2/664 = 1/332. So the answer is 1/332 chapters per day. But that's not a whole number. Maybe the question is expecting the number of chapters per day as a whole number. If the answer is 1/332, that's not a sensible answer. So perhaps there's a mistake in the problem. Wait, maybe the book has more chapters. Let me check the problem again. No, the problem says 2 chapters. So maybe I need to recheck the calculation. Let me compute 2 divided by 664. Let's see, 664 divided by 2 is 332. So 2/664 = 1/332. So the answer is 1/332 chapters per day. But that's not a whole number. Hmm. Maybe the question is asking for pages per day. No, the question is about chapters. So I think the answer is 1/332. But perhaps the answer expects a different approach. Wait, maybe the problem is phrased differently. Let me read it again.\n\n\"Frank was reading through his favorite book. The book had 2 chapters each with 405 pages. It took frank 664 days to finish the book.

So the answer is 1/332. But the problem might expect a whole number. Maybe there's a mistake in the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking how many pages per day he read. Pages per day would be 810 / 664 \u2248 1.221 pages per day. But the question asks about chapters per day. So I think the correct answer is 1/332 chapters per day.

He took 664 days. So pages per day is 810/664 \u2248 1.221 pages per day. But the question is about chapters per day. So perhaps the answer is 2/664 = 1/332. So the answer is 1/332 chapters per day. But maybe the answer expects a fraction. So perhaps the answer is 1/332. But in the answer format, it should be a number. So maybe it's 0.00302, but that's not a whole number. Hmm. Maybe the problem has a mistake. Or perhaps I missed something. Wait, maybe the question is about the total chapters he read. Wait, the problem says \"how many chapters did he read per day.\" So if he read 2 chapters in 664 days, then per day it's 2/664 = 1/332. So the answer is 1/332 chapters per day. But the problem might expect a different answer. Let me check again. The problem says \"how many chapters did he read per day.\" So 2 chapters in 664 days is 2/664 = 1/332. So the answer is 1/332. Wait, but 1/332 is approximately 0.00302. Which is not a sensible number. So perhaps the answer is 0.00302 chapters per day. But the problem probably expects a whole number. Maybe I made a mistake in the problem's setup. Let me re-express the problem.\n\nWait, the book has 2 chapters. Each chapter has 405 pages. Total pages: 2 * 405 = 810. Time taken: 664 days. So chapters per day is 2 / 664 = 1 / 332. So the answer is 1/332. But the problem might have a different approach. Let me think again. If he read 2 chapters in 664 days, then per day he read 2/664 = 1/332 chapters. So the answer is 1/332 chapters per day. So the correct answer is 1/332. But perhaps the answer is presented as a fraction. So the answer is 1/332. But maybe the problem expects a whole number. Maybe there's a miscalculation. Wait, perhaps the question is asking for pages per day. No, pages per day is 810/664 \u2248 1.221 pages per day. Not what the question is asking. So I think the answer is 1/332.

So 2 divided by 664. That would be 2/664, which simplifies to 1/332. But that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again.\n\nThe book has 2 chapters, each with 405 pages. So total pages: 2 * 405 = 810. He took 664 days to finish. So chapters per day would be total chapters divided by total days. So 2 chapters / 664 days = 2/664 = 1/332. But that can't be right. Maybe the question is asking for pages per day. No, the question says chapters per day. So perhaps there's a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, the problem is about chapters per day. Let me rephrase. The total chapters are 2. He took 664 days to finish. So chapters per day is 2 divided by 664. Which is 2/664 = 1/332. Hmm, that seems really low. But maybe that's correct. Let me verify the total pages again. 2 chapters * 405 pages each = 810 pages. 810 pages in 664 days. So chapters per day is 2/664 = 1/332. But that can't be right. Maybe the problem is phrased differently. Let me read it again.\n\n\"The book had 2 chapters each with 405 pages. It took frank 664 days to finish the book. How many chapters did he read per day?\" Oh, wait, maybe the question is asking how many chapters he read per day. So total chapters (2) divided by total days (664). So 2/664 = 1/332. Which is a very low number. But perhaps that's correct. Let me check the calculations again.\n\nTotal pages: 2 * 405 = 810. Total days: 664. Chapters per day: 2 / 664 = 1/332. So the answer is 1/332 chapters per day. But the question says \"how many chapters did he read per day?\" So maybe the answer is 1/332. But that seems odd. Maybe the problem is intended to be different. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe the question is asking for pages per day. If so, then 810 pages / 664 days = 1.224 pages per day. But the question doesn't mention pages. It's about chapters. So I must have made a mistake. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe book has 2 chapters, each with 405 pages. Total pages: 2 * 405 = 810. Time taken: 664 days. How many chapters per day? So 2 chapters / 664 days = 2/664 = 1/332. But that's not a whole number. So maybe the answer is 1/332 chapters per day. But that's not a sensible answer. Maybe the question is a trick question. Let me check if there's a calculation mistake.\n\nWait, maybe the question is about pages per day. No, the question says chapters per day. So the answer must be 2/664 = 1/332. So the answer is 1/332 chapters per day. But that seems really small. Let me see if there's another way to approach it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for total chapters read per day, which would be 2 chapters / 664 days = 1/332 chapters per day. So the answer is 1/332. But that seems really low. Maybe the problem is phrased differently. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is not about chapters but pages. If that's the case, then 810 pages / 664 days = 1.224 pages per day. But the question asks for chapters per day. So regardless of whether it's pages or chapters, the calculation would be chapters divided by days. So 2/664 = 1/332. So the answer is 1/332 chapters per day. But that seems very low. Maybe the problem is expecting an integer answer, but that's not possible. So perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement. But given the information provided, the answer is 1/332.

The problem says that Paul got a box of some crayons for his birthday. By the end of the school year, he had lost or given away 551 crayons, and he was left with 177. The question is asking how many crayons he got for his birthday. \n\nHmm, so basically, the total number of crayons he had initially minus the number he lost or gave away equals the number he has left. So the formula should be: initial crayons = crayons left + crayons lost. Oh, right, so if he has 177 left and lost 551, then the initial amount must be 177 plus 551. Let me check that. \n\nWait, let me make sure I'm not mixing up the numbers. The problem says he lost or gave away 551, so that's the number he subtracted. So initial crayons minus 551 equals 177. So to find the initial, I need to add 551 and 177. Let me do that calculation. 551 plus 177. Let's see, 551 + 170 is 721, and then plus 7 more is 728. So 551 + 177 = 728.

The problem says that during summer break, 61619 kids from Lawrence county stayed home, and the rest went to camp. The total number of kids in the county is 91676. We need to find out how many kids went to camp. \n\nHmm, so first, I should figure out how many kids went to camp. Oh, right, that would be the total number of kids minus the ones who stayed home. So the total is 91676, and 61619 stayed home. So subtracting those two numbers should give the number of kids who went to camp. Let me write that down.\n\n91676 minus 61619. Let me do that calculation. Let's see, 91676 minus 60000 is 31676. Then subtract 1619 more. So 31676 minus 1619. Let me compute that. 31676 minus 1000 is 30676. Then minus 619. 30676 - 600 = 30076, then -19 = 30057. So 30057. Wait, wait, let me check that again. 91676 - 61619. Let me do it another way to be sure. 91676 minus 61619. Maybe break it down: 91676 - 60000 = 31676. Then 31676 - 1619. Let's subtract 1600 first: 31676 - 1600 = 30076. Then subtract 19: 30076 - 19 = 30057. Yes, that seems right. So 30057 kids went to camp.\n\nBut the question says \"about how many.\" Oh, maybe they want an approximate number. The numbers given are 61619 and 91676. Let me see if I can estimate. 91676 minus 61619. If I round both numbers. 91676 is about 90000, and 61619 is about 60000. So 90000 - 60000 = 30000. But the actual numbers are a bit more. Wait, 91676 is a bit more than 90000, and 61619 is a bit more than 60000. So the difference would be a bit less than 30000. Let me verify the exact calculation again. 91676 - 61619. Let's do it step by step. 91676 - 60000 = 31676. 31676 - 1619 = 30057. So the exact number is 30057. The question says \"about how many,\" so the answer is 30057. But maybe the answer should be rounded. The problem says \"about how many,\" so maybe they want a rounded number. Let me check the problem again. Oh, the numbers are 61619 and 91676. So 91676 - 61619 = 30057. So the answer is 30057. But maybe the question expects a different approach. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculation. Let me recompute. 61619 plus 30057. Let's add them. 61619 + 30057. 61619 + 30000 = 91619. Then 91619 + 57 = 91676. Oh, wait, that's the total. Wait, no. Wait, 61619 + 30057. Let me add them properly. 61619 + 30057. Let's break it down: 61619 + 30000 = 91619. Then 91619 + 57 = 91676. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 61619 + 30057. Let me do it again. 61619 + 30057. Let's add the numbers digit by digit. \n\n61619\n+30057\n= (60000 + 1619) + (30000 + 057)\n= 90000 + 1619 + 30000 + 57\n= 120000 + 2076\n= 122076. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, maybe I messed up the addition. Let me try again. 61619 + 30057. Let's align the numbers:\n\n  61619\n- 30057\n= ?\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n9 + 7 = 16. Write 6, carry over 1.\n1 + 5 + 1 (carry over) = 7. Write 7.\n6 + 0 = 6. Write 6.\n1 + 3 = 4. Write 4.\n6 (the leftmost digit remains 6).\n\nSo 61619 + 30057 = 91676. Wait, that's the same as the total. Oh, wait, that's the total number of kids. So 91676 - 61619 = 30057. So the answer is 30057. So the exact number is 30057. The question says \"about how many,\" so the answer is 30057. So the answer is 30057.\n</LONG_COT>\n<ANSWER>\n30057\n</ANSWER>", "answer": "30057", "is_correct": true, "token_count": 1422}}

The problem is about harvesting oranges. So, he finds out that they harvest 74 sacks per day and discard 71 of them. We need to find out how many sacks they will have after 51 days. Hmm, right. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the daily harvest is 74 sacks. But they discard 71 of them each day. So, the number of sacks they actually use each day would be 74 minus 71. Let me calculate that. 74 minus 71 is 3. So, each day, they harvest 3 sacks after discarding the 71. \n\nNow, the total number of days is 51. So, over 51 days, the total sacks harvested would be 3 sacks per day multiplied by 51 days. Let me do that multiplication. 3 times 51. Let's see, 3 times 50 is 150, and 3 times 1 is 3. So 150 + 3 = 153. So 3 * 51 = 153. \n\nWait, but wait a second. The question is asking how many sacks they will have after 51 days. So, if they harvest 3 sacks each day, then after 51 days, it's 3 * 51 = 153. But the problem says they discard 71 of them each day. Oh, wait, does that mean that after harvesting 74 sacks each day, they discard 71, so the net is 3 per day. So yes, that's correct. \n\nSo the answer should be 153. Let me double-check. Each day, they harvest 74 and discard 71. So net sacks per day is 74 - 71 = 3. Over 51 days, 3 * 51 = 153. That seems right. I don't see any mistakes here.

The problem is about the Razorback shop selling jerseys and t-shirts. They make $115 off each jersey and $25 off each t-shirt. They sold 113 t-shirts and 78 jerseys. The question is how much more does a jersey cost than a t-shirt.\n\nHmm, so first, I need to find out the profit from each item. For t-shirts, it's 113 t-shirts multiplied by $25 each. And for jerseys, it's 78 jerseys multiplied by $115 each. Then, subtract the t-shirt profit from the jersey profit to find the difference. Wait, the question asks how much more a jersey costs than a t-shirt. Oh, wait, no. Wait, the question is how much more does a jersey cost than a t-shirt. So the cost per jersey minus the cost per t-shirt. But wait, the problem says they make $115 off each jersey and $25 off each t-shirt. So the cost per jersey is $115, and the cost per t-shirt is $25. So the difference would be $115 - $25 = $90. Oh, that's straightforward. So the answer is $90. Let me double-check the calculations.\n\nCalculating the profit from t-shirts: 113 * 25. Let's compute that. 100 * 25 = 2500, 13 * 25 = 325. So 2500 + 325 = 2825. So $2825 from t-shirts.\n\nProfit from jerseys: 78 * 115. Let me calculate that. 78 * 100 = 7800, 78 * 15 = 1170. So 7800 + 1170 = 8970. So $8970 from jerseys.\n\nThe difference in cost per item is 115 - 25 = 90. So the answer should be $90. Yeah, that makes sense. So the jersey costs $90 more than a t-shirt.

The question is asking how much more a jersey costs than a t-shirt.\n\nHmm, so first, I need to find the profit from the jerseys and the t-shirts, then subtract the cost of a t-shirt from the cost of a jersey to find the difference. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nThe profit from jerseys is calculated by multiplying the number of jerseys sold by the price per jersey. So that's 78 jerseys * $115 per jersey. Let me do that calculation. 78 * 115. Let's see, 70 * 115 is 7850, and 8 * 115 is 920. So 7850 + 920 = 8770. So the total profit from jerseys is $8,770.\n\nThen the profit from t-shirts is 113 t-shirts * $25 per t-shirt. Let me calculate that. 113 * 25. Hmm, 100 * 25 is 2500, 13 * 25 is 325. So 2500 + 325 = 2825. So the total profit from t-shirts is $2,825.\n\nNow, the question asks how much more a jersey costs than a t-shirt.

So the jersey costs $90 more than a t-shirt.\n\nWait, let me double-check the numbers to make sure I didn't make a mistake. The jersey profit: 78 * 115. Let me calculate that again. 78 * 100 = 7800, 78 * 15 = 1170. So 7800 + 1170 = 8970. Oh, wait, no. Wait, 78 * 115. Let me do it correctly. 78 * 100 = 7800, 78 * 10 = 780, 78 * 5 = 390. So 7800 + 780 = 8580, plus 390 is 8970. No, that's not right. Wait, no. Wait, 78 * 115. Let me do it another way. 78 * 100 = 7800, 78 * 10 = 780, 78 * 5 = 390. So 7800 + 780 = 8580, plus 390 is 8970. Wait, no. Wait, 78 * 115. Let me compute 78 * 115. 78 * (100 + 15) = 78*100 + 78*15 = 7800 + 1170 = 8970. Yes, that's correct. So the jersey profit is $8,970. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says $115 per jersey. Oh, wait, the problem says $115 dollars off each jersey. Wait, no, that's probably a typo. Maybe they meant $115 per jersey. Because if they were selling them for $115 each, then the profit per jersey is $115. So that part seems right. So the calculation for jerseys is 78 * 115 = 8970. T-shirts: 113 * 25 = 2825.

If he ended up with 15 books after buying 42, that means before buying the 42, he must have had 15 minus 42 books. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no. Let me think again. He started with 21. Then he sold some, so let's call the number of books he sold as S. Then he bought 42. So the total books now would be 21 - S + 42. Because he sold S books and bought 42. So the total is 21 - S + 42 = 63 - S. And that equals 15. So 63 - S = 15. Then solving for S: S = 63 - 15 = 48. So he sold 48 books. \n\nNow, the question is how many more books he sold than he bought. He bought 42 books. So the difference is 48 - 42 = 6. So he sold 6 more books than he bought. Wait, let me check that again. \n\nWait, let's go through the steps again. Starting books: 21. Sold some, so let's say he sold S books. Then bought 42. So total books now are 21 - S + 42 = 63 - S. According to the problem, this equals 15. So 63 - S = 15. Solving for S: S = 63 - 15 = 48. So he sold 48 books. He bought 42. The difference is 48 - 42 = 6. So the answer should be 6. \n\nYes, that makes sense. Let me verify. If he sold 48 books, he had 21 - 48 = -27 books left. Then he bought 42, so total is -27 + 42 = 15. Yes, that's correct.

The problem is about Paul's books. He started with 21 books. Then he sold some and bought 42 new ones. Now he has 15 books. The question is, how many more books did he sell than he bought?\n\nHmm, let's break this down. Let's find out how many books he sold first. If he ended up with 15 books after buying 42, that means before buying the 42, he must have had 15 minus 42 books. Wait, no. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says he bought 42 new ones. So the total books he has now is the original 21 minus the books he sold plus 42. Because he bought 42 after selling some. So the equation should be: 21 - x + 42 = 15, where x is the number of books he sold. Wait, no. Wait, maybe I should think of it differently.\n\nLet me rephrase. Let's let the number of books he sold be S. He bought 42. So the total books now are 21 - S + 42 = 15. Because he had 21, sold S, then bought 42. So the equation is 21 - S + 42 = 15. Simplifying that: 63 - S = 15. Then S = 63 - 15 = 48. So he sold 48 books. But the question is how many more books he sold than he bought. He bought 42. So 48 - 42 = 6. So the answer is 6. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, let's go through the steps again. He started with 21. Sold some, let's say S books. So books left after selling: 21 - S. Then he bought 42. So total books now: 21 - S + 42 = 63 - S. According to the problem, this equals 15. So 63 - S = 15. Solving for S: S = 63 - 15 = 48. So he sold 48 books. He bought 42. The difference is 48 - 42 = 6.

Let me calculate that. 28 divided by 14 is 2. So each bag has 2 cookies. That part seems straightforward.\n\nNow, the problem mentions 86 candies in total.

But wait, let me verify the total candies part to be sure.\n\nThe total candies are 86. But the question doesn't say anything about the candies per bag or the total number of bags. It just mentions 86 candies in total. Maybe the candies are not related to the number of bags of cookies. So maybe the problem is just about the cookies.

If you had 28 cookies and 86 candies in total, how many bags of cookies do you have?\" So the total candies are 86, but the question is about the cookies. So the answer should be 14 bags of cookies. Because the problem gives the total cookies as 28, and each bag has 28/14 = 2 cookies per bag. So 14 bags. The candies are probably there to confuse, but the question asks about the cookies.

The problem says the grocery store had 22 bottles of regular soda and 61 bottles of diet soda. We need to find out how many more bottles of diet soda than regular soda they had. \n\nSo, the first step is to find the difference between the number of diet soda bottles and regular soda bottles. That means I need to subtract the number of regular soda bottles from the number of diet soda bottles. Let me write that down: 61 (diet) - 22 (regular). \n\nLet me do the subtraction. 61 minus 22. Let's see, 61 minus 20 is 41, and then minus 2 more is 39. So the difference is 39. \n\nWait, let me double-check. 22 regular, 61 diet. Yes, 61 minus 22 is 39. That makes sense. So the answer should be 39. \n\nHmm, another way to think about it is to add the two numbers together and then subtract the regular ones.

Let me verify again. \n\nWait, 907,611 plus 455,682. Let me do the addition more carefully. \n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n1 + 2 = 3.\n\n1 + 8 = 9.\n\n6 + 6 = 12. Carry over 1.\n\n1 + 5 = 6, plus the carried 1 is 7.\n\n7 + 4 = 11. Carry over 1.\n\n0 + 4 = 4, plus 1 is 5.\n\n9 + 5 = 14.

Let me recheck the addition. \n\nWait, let me do it step by step again. \n\n907,611\n+ 455,682\n= ?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n1 + 2 = 3.\n\n1 + 8 = 9.\n\n6 + 6 = 12. Carry over 1.\n\n7 + 6 = 13. Carry over 1.\n\n6 + 8 = 14. Carry over 1.\n\n0 + 4 = 4. Add the carried 1: 5.\n\n9 + 5 = 14. Add the carried 1: 15. Write 5, carry 1.\n\n9 + 4 = 13. Add the carried 1: 14. Write 4, carry 1.\n\n1 (from 907,611) + 4 (from 455,682) = 5. Add the carried 1: 6.\n\nSo the total is 1,363,293. Wait, that's 1,363,293. Hmm, that seems high. Let me check the addition again. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the alignment. Let me write it out properly. \n\n907,611\n+ 455,682\n= ?\n\nAlign the numbers:\n\n  907,611\n+ 455,682\n= ?\n\nLet me add the numbers digit by digit from right to left:\n\nStarting from the units place: 1 + 2 = 3.\n\nTens place: 1 + 8 = 9.\n\nHundreds place: 6 + 6 = 12. Carry over 1.\n\nThousands place: 7 + 5 = 12 + 1 (carryover) = 13.\n\nTen thousands place: 0 + 4 = 4.\n\nHundred thousands place: 9 + 4 = 13.\n\nSo the total is 1,363,293. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, let me verify the addition again. \n\n907,611 + 455,682. Let's compute 907,611 + 455,682.\n\n907,611 + 455,682 = (907,611 + 455,682) = 1,363,293. Yes, that's correct. \n\nSo the total number of kids in Lawrence county is 1,363,293. So the answer is 1,363,293. But wait, the problem says \"about how many kids.\" Oh, the question says \"about how many kids,\" so maybe they want an approximate number. But the exact number is 1,363,293.

The problem is about Danny collecting bottle caps and wrappers. He found 66 wrappers and 39 bottle caps at the park. Now, he has 16 bottle caps and 68 wrappers in his collection. The question is asking how many wrappers he had at first.\n\nHmm, right. So, let's break this down. Initially, he found 66 wrappers and 39 bottle caps. Now, after collecting more, he has 16 bottle caps and 68 wrappers. We need to find the original number of wrappers he had.\n\nOh, wait. So the change in the number of bottle caps is 16 - 39. Because now he has 16, and he had 39 initially. But the wrappers changed from 66 to 68. So the increase in wrappers is 68 - 66. Let me write that down.\n\nLet me define the variables. Let's say the original number of wrappers is W. He found 66 wrappers at the park, so the total wrappers now are W + 66. According to the problem, now he has 68 wrappers. So:\n\nW + 66 = 68\n\nTo find W, I subtract 66 from both sides:\n\nW = 68 - 66\n\nW = 2\n\nSo he originally had 2 wrappers. Let me double-check. If he had 2 wrappers initially and found 66 more, then he now has 68. That matches the problem statement. And the bottle caps: he had 39 and now has 16. The problem doesn't mention any change in bottle caps, so that part is already given.

The problem is about three people doing push-ups. Zachary did 15 push-ups. David did 39 more than Zachary. Then John did 9 less than David. The question is how many more push-ups Zachary did than John. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, Zachary's push-ups are given as 15. David did 39 more than Zachary. So I need to calculate how many push-ups David did. That would be 15 plus 39. Let me add those numbers. 15 + 39 = 54. So David did 54 push-ups.\n\nNext, John did 9 less than David. So I subtract 9 from David's total. That's 54 - 9. Let's do that. 54 minus 9 is 45. So John did 45 push-ups.\n\nNow, the question asks how many more push-ups Zachary did than John. Zachary did 15 and John did 45. So I subtract John's count from Zachary's. That's 15 - 45. Wait, that can't be right. Oh, wait, no.

Wait, no, let me check my steps again.\n\nZachary: 15. David: 15 + 39 = 54. John: 54 - 9 = 45. Then Zachary (15) minus John (45) is 15 - 45 = -30. That means John did 30 more than Zachary. But the question asks how many more Zachary did than John, which would be a negative number. But that doesn't make sense. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me recheck each step.\n\nWait, David did 39 more than Zachary. So David = 15 + 39 = 54. Correct. John did 9 less than David. So John = 54 - 9 = 45. Yes. Then Zachary is 15, John is 45. The difference is 15 - 45 = -30. Which means John did 30 more than Zachary. So the question asks how many more Zachary did than John, which is negative. But the problem says \"how many more push-ups did Zachary do than John?\" So the answer would be 15 - 45 = -30. But that can't be right. Maybe I misread the question.

Wait, maybe I messed up the order. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe the question is phrased differently. Let me read it again. \"Zachary did 15 push-ups. David did 39 more push-ups than Zachary. John did 9 push-ups less than David. How many more push-ups did Zachary do than John?\" Yes, that's correct. So the answer is 15 - 45 = -30. But the problem might expect a positive number. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again.\n\nWait, David is 39 more than Zachary. So David = 15 + 39 = 54. John is 9 less than David. So John = 54 - 9 = 45.

But the problem probably expects a positive number. Maybe I need to recheck the problem statement.\n\nAh, maybe I misread the question. Let me read it again. \"Zachary did 15 push-ups. David did 39 more push-ups than Zachary. John did 9 push-ups less than David. How many more push-ups did Zachary do than John?\" Yes, that's correct. So the answer is 15 - 45 = -30. But the problem might want the absolute value. Hmm. Maybe I need to rephrase the question. Wait, maybe the question is asking how many more John did than Zachary, which would be 45 - 15 = 30. But that's not what the question says. The question says \"how many more push-ups did Zachary do than John?\" So the answer is 15 - 45 = -30. But that can't be right. Maybe I made a mistake in the numbers.\n\nWait, let me try again. Zachary: 15. David: 15 + 39 = 54. John: 54 - 9 = 45. Zachary - John: 15 - 45 = -30. So the answer is -30. But the question asks \"how many more\", which is a positive number. Perhaps I need to recheck the problem. Oh, maybe I mixed up the numbers. Let me check once more.\n\nYes, David is 39 more than Zachary. So David = 15 + 39 = 54. John is 9 less than David, so John = 54 - 9 = 45. Then Zachary is 15, John is 45. The difference is 15 - 45 = -30. So the answer is -30. But the question asks \"how many more\", so the answer is -30. But maybe there's a mistake here. Wait, maybe the question is asking how many more John did than Zachary, which would be 45 -15 =30. But the question says \"how many more push-ups did Zachary do than John?\" So the answer is -30. But that can't be right. Maybe I need to rephrase the question. Wait, perhaps I need to find the absolute difference. But the question doesn't say \"how many more\". Let me read the problem again.\n\nAh, wait, the problem says \"how many more push-ups did Zachary do than John?\" So yes, it's a simple subtraction. The answer is 15 -45 = -30. So the answer is -30. But the problem might expect a positive number. Maybe I made a mistake in the numbers. Let me check the problem again.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the numbers. Let me recheck. David did 39 more than Zachary. So David = 15 +39 =54. John did 9 less than David. So John =54-9=45. Zachary is 15. So 15 -45 = -30. So the answer is -30. But the question is phrased as \"how many more\", which implies a positive number. Maybe there's a mistake in the problem. Wait, perhaps I should recheck all the steps.

But the question is asking \"how many more\", which is a positive number. So the answer is 30. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Wait, no. Let me think again. If John did 9 less than David, then David is 15 +39 =54. John is 54 -9 =45. Zachary is 15. The difference is 15 -45 = -30. So the answer is -30. But the question is asking \"how many more\", which would be the absolute value. So the answer is 30. Hmm. Maybe I need to check the problem again. Oh, wait, the question says \"how many more push-ups did Zachary do than John?\" So the answer is 15 -45 = -30. So the answer is -30.

If Zachary did 15, then David is 15 plus 39. Let me add those numbers. 15 + 39 = 54. So David did 54 push-ups.\n\nNext, John did 9 push-ups less than David. So I need to subtract 9 from David's total. That would be 54 - 9. Let's do that. 54 minus 9 is 45. So John did 45 push-ups.\n\nNow, the question asks how many more push-ups Zachary did than John.

That means John did 30 more than Zachary. But the question asks \"how many more push-ups did Zachary do than John?\" So it's a negative number, which doesn't make sense in this context. Hmm, that can't be right. Let me read the problem again.\n\nOh, wait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me recheck. The problem says: Zachary did 15 push-ups. David did 39 more than Zachary. John did 9 less than David. How many more push-ups did Zachary do than John? So yes, that's correct. So Zachary: 15, David: 15+39=54, John: 54-9=45. Then Zachary - John = 15 - 45 = -30.

Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again.\n\nZachary: 15. David: 15 + 39 = 54. Correct. John: 54 - 9 = 45. Correct. Then 15 - 45 = -30. So the answer is -30. But that can't be. The question must have a different answer. Maybe I misread the problem. Let me read it again.\n\nOh, wait, the problem says \"John did 9 push-ups less than David.\" So John = David - 9. Yes. So Zachary is 15, David is 54, John is 45. So Zachary is 15, John is 45. The question is \"how many more did Zachary do than John?\" So 15 - 45 = -30. So the answer is -30. But the problem probably expects a positive number. Maybe there's a mistake in the problem. Wait, the problem says \"how many more push-ups did Zachary do than John?\" So the answer is 15 - 45 = -30. Which means John did 30 more than Zachary. So the answer is 30. Oh, maybe I need to take the absolute value. No, the question is phrased correctly. So the answer is -30. But that's not right. Hmm. Maybe I should recheck the problem statement.\n\nWait, the problem says \"John did 9 push-ups less than David.\" So John = David - 9. Correct. So David is 54, John is 45. Then Zachary is 15. So the difference is 15 - 45 = -30. So the answer is -30, which is -30 more. The question says \"how many more\", which would be the absolute difference. So 30. So the answer is 30. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the order. Let me check again.\n\nYes, Zachary: 15. David: 15 + 39 = 54. John: 54 - 9 = 45. Then Zachary - John = 15 - 45 = -30. So the answer is -30. But the question asks \"how many more\", which is positive. So maybe there's a mistake in the problem. Let me check the problem again.\n\nAh, maybe the problem says \"how many more push-ups did Zachary do than John?\" So yes, the answer is 15 - 45 = -30. So the answer is -30. But that's not possible. Maybe there's a typo. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking \"how many more than John\" in absolute terms. So the answer is 30. So I think the correct answer is 30. Hmm. So perhaps the answer is 30. Let me confirm once more.\n\nYes, David did 54, John did 45, Zachary did 15. So 54 - 45 = 9, and 15 - 45 = -30. The question is \"how many more push-ups did Zachary do than John?\" So the answer is -30, which is the same as John did 30 more. So the answer is 30. So the correct answer is 30.\n</LONG_COT>\n<ANSWER>\n30\n</ANSWER>", "answer": "30", "is_correct": true, "token_count": 1645}}

The problem is about Lewis's earnings and rent during the harvest season. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the question says Lewis earns $368 every week during the 1359 weeks of harvest. So I need to calculate his total earnings over those 1359 weeks. Then, he has to pay $388 rent every week. The question is asking how much money he pays as rent during the harvest season.\n\nAlright, let's start with the earnings part. If he earns $368 each week for 1359 weeks, then the total earnings would be 368 multiplied by 1359. Let me calculate that. But wait, maybe there's a smarter way. Maybe I can do it in two steps. First, find out how much he earns in total, then subtract the rent he pays each week to get the total rent paid.\n\nWait, the problem says he has to pay $388 rent every week. So the total rent paid would be 388 multiplied by 1359. So I need to compute 388 * 1359. Let me do that calculation. \n\nLet me break down 388 * 1359. Maybe I can use the distributive property. 388 * 1359 = 388 * (1000 + 300 + 50 + 9) = 388*1000 + 388*300 + 388*50 + 388*9. Let's compute each term:\n\n388 * 1000 = 388,000\n\n388 * 300 = 116,400\n\n388 * 50 = 19,400\n\n388 * 9 = 3,492\n\nNow add all those together: 388,000 + 116,400 = 504,400; 504,400 + 19,400 = 523,800; 523,800 + 3,492 = 527,292. So the total rent paid is $527,292.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. 388 * 1359. Let me compute 388 * 1000 = 388,000. 388 * 300 = 116,400. 388 * 50 = 19,400. 388 * 9 = 3,492. Adding those: 388,000 + 116,400 = 504,400; 504,400 + 19,400 = 523,800; 523,800 + 3,492 = 527,292. Yes, that seems right.\n\nSo the total rent paid is $527,292. Let me make sure there's no mistake in the problem statement. The question says \"How much money does he pay as rent during the harvest season?\" So the answer is the total rent paid, which is 388 * 1359. Which we calculated as 527,292.\n\nWait, let me re-read the problem to make sure I didn't miss anything. Oh, the problem says he earns $368 every week for 1359 weeks. Then he has to pay $388 rent every week. So the total rent is $388 per week times 1359 weeks. That's exactly what we calculated. So the answer is 527,292.

Let me think.\n\nWait, the recipe requires 11 cups of sugar, 6 cups of flour, and 9 cups of salt. She has added 12 cups of flour. So the flour is more than required. The question is about sugar and salt. So the total needed for sugar is 11 cups, and for salt is 9 cups. She hasn't added any sugar or salt yet. So the answer would be 11 - 9 = 2.

So the width should be 2 feet. \n\nLet me double-check. If the room is 7 feet long and 2 feet wide, the area is 7 \u00d7 2 = 14 square feet. That matches the given area. So yeah, the width is 2 feet.

The problem is about a farmer who had 175 tomatoes and 77 potatoes. He picked 172 potatoes. We need to find out how many tomatoes and potatoes he has left. \n\nHmm, right. So first, I should figure out how many potatoes are left after picking 172. He originally had 77 potatoes. Subtracting 172 from 77... wait, that can't be right because 172 is more than 77. So if he picked 172 potatoes, which is more than he had, he would have none left. So 77 minus 172 is a negative number, which doesn't make sense in this context. Wait, maybe I misunderstood the problem. Let me read it again.\n\n\"A farmer had 175 tomatoes and 77 potatoes in his garden. If he picked 172 potatoes, how many tomatoes and potatoes does he have left?\" \n\nOh, wait, the problem says he picked 172 potatoes. But he only had 77 potatoes. So he can't pick 172. That must mean he picked all he had and some more, which is impossible. So maybe there's a mistake in the problem. But assuming the problem is correct as stated, perhaps there's a typo, and he picked 22 potatoes instead of 172. But the question is given as is. So perhaps I need to proceed under the assumption that the problem is correct, even if it's not realistic. \n\nWait, maybe the problem meant he picked 22 potatoes instead of 172. But the question is as given. So let's go with the given numbers. \n\nSo, he had 77 potatoes. He picked 172. So the number of potatoes left would be 77 - 172. Which is -95. But that can't be right. So perhaps the problem is wrong, but given that, we have to proceed. \n\nSo, tomatoes remain at 175. Potatoes left are 77 - 172 = -95. Which is impossible. So maybe the problem expects us to ignore the negative number and just state the remaining tomatoes. Because even if he picked all the potatoes, he still has tomatoes. So the answer would be 175 tomatoes and -95 potatoes. But that doesn't make sense. So perhaps there's a mistake in the problem. But assuming the problem is correct, the answer would be 175 tomatoes and 0 potatoes left. Wait, but 77 - 172 is -95, which is impossible. So maybe the problem meant he picked 22 potatoes. Let me check the problem again. \n\nAh, maybe the problem meant he picked 22 potatoes instead of 172. If that's the case, then he would have 77 - 22 = 55 potatoes left. Then, tomatoes remain at 175. So the answer would be 175 tomatoes and 55 potatoes. But the problem as given says he picked 172, which is way more than he had. So perhaps the answer is even if he picked all he had, he still has tomatoes. So the answer is 175 tomatoes and 0 potatoes. Wait, but 77 - 172 is -95, which is impossible. So maybe the problem is correct, and the answer is 175 tomatoes and 0 potatoes. Because even if he picked all the potatoes, he still has tomatoes. So the answer is 175. \n\nWait, let me recheck. The question says \"how many tomatoes and potatoes does he have left?\" So tomatoes are 175, potatoes are 77 - 172 = -95. So total left is 175 + (-95) = 80. So the answer is 80. Oh, wait, that makes sense. Because he picked 172 potatoes, which is more than he had (77), so he has none left. Then he has 175 tomatoes. So total left is 175 + 0 = 175. So the answer is 175. \n\nYes, that seems correct. So the answer is 175.\n</LONG_COT>\n<ANSWER>\n175\n</ANSWER>", "answer": "175", "is_correct": false, "token_count": 946}}

If he still has 8 pieces of candy left How many pieces of candy had he eaten at the start?", "data_source": "my_data/SVAMP", "ground_truth": "9", "adaptive": {"response": "<LONG_COT>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about Bobby having 22 pieces of candy. He ate some pieces, then ate 5 more, and now he has 8 left. We need to find out how many he ate at the start. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nSo, let's start with the initial amount. Bobby had 22 pieces. Then he ate some pieces, let's call that number x. After eating x pieces, he ate 5 more. So that's x + 5 pieces eaten in total. Now, after all this eating, he has 8 left. So the equation should be the initial amount minus the total eaten equals the remaining amount. \n\nLet me write that out. Initial candy: 22. After eating x pieces and then 5 more, he has 8 left. So the equation is 22 - (x + 5) = 8. Let me check that. Yes, because he first eats x, then 5 more. So total eaten is x + 5. Subtract that from 22 gives 8. \n\nNow, let's solve for x. Expanding the equation: 22 - x - 5 = 8. Simplify the left side: 22 - 5 is 17, so 17 - x = 8. Then, add x to both sides: 17 = 8 + x. Subtract 8 from both sides: 17 - 8 = x. So x = 9. \n\nWait, let me verify. If he started with 22, ate 9 pieces, then ate 5 more. So 22 - 9 = 13, then 13 - 5 = 8. Yes, that matches the problem. So the answer should be 9. \n\nLet me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. The problem says \"he ate some pieces of candy. Then he ate 5 more.\" So the order is important. First, some pieces, then 5 more. So total eaten is x + 5. Yes. So initial - (x + 5) = 8. Solving gives x = 9.

Let's call the number of green peaches in each basket as \\( g \\). Then, the total number of peaches in one basket would be 4 (red) + \\( g \\) (green).

The problem is about harvesting oranges. So, they harvest 16 sacks per day, and each sack has 57 oranges. The question is, how many days will it take to harvest 80 sacks of oranges? Hmm, right. So I need to find the total number of days required.\n\nWait, first, maybe I should figure out the total number of oranges needed. If there are 80 sacks, and each sack has 57 oranges, then the total oranges would be 80 multiplied by 57. Let me calculate that. 80 times 57. Let's see, 80 times 50 is 4000, and 80 times 7 is 560. So 4000 + 560 = 4560. So total oranges are 4560.\n\nNow, since they harvest 16 sacks per day, the number of days needed is the total sacks divided by the sacks per day. So 80 sacks divided by 16 sacks per day. That's 80 / 16. 16 times 5 is 80, so 5. So it would take 5 days. Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check. \n\nYes, 16 sacks per day for 5 days would be 16 * 5 = 80 sacks. Which matches the required number. And the total oranges would be 80 * 57. Let me confirm that calculation again. 80 * 57. 80 * 50 is 4000, 80 * 7 is 560. 4000 + 560 = 4560. Correct. So yes, 4560 oranges in total. Divided by 57 oranges per sack. 4560 / 57.

The grasshopper jumped 39 inches, which is 19 inches farther than the frog. So if the frog's jump is \\( F \\) inches, then \\( 39 = F + 19 \\).

Let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nThe grasshopper: 39 inches. Frog: 39 - 19 = 20 inches. Mouse: 20 - 12 = 8 inches. That seems right. Let me confirm all the numbers.

That would be 28 times 11. Let me calculate that. \n\nWait, 28 times 10 is 280, and then 28 times 1 is 28. So 280 plus 28 is 308. So the total should be 308 peaches. \n\nLet me double-check. Each basket has 10 + 18 = 28. 11 baskets times 28 peaches each. Yep, 11 times 28. Let me do that again. 28 times 10 is 280, 28 times 1 is 28. 280 + 28 = 308. That seems right. \n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here.

The problem is about calculating the number of buses needed for a school field trip. The school has 72 classrooms, each with 3 seats on the bus. There are 111 students in total. Hmm, wait, the number of classrooms and seats per bus doesn't directly relate to the number of students, so maybe I need to focus on the students first.\n\nSo, the total number of students is 111. Each bus has 3 seats. Wait, but usually, a bus has seats for passengers, not classrooms. So maybe each bus can carry 3 students? That doesn't make sense. Oh, maybe the \"3 seats on each school bus\" refers to the number of students each bus can carry. So each bus can hold 3 students. Oh, that's a possible interpretation. Let me check that again.\n\nThe problem says: \"There are 3 seats on each school bus.\" Hmm, maybe each bus has 3 seats, but maybe each seat can hold a student. So each bus can carry 3 students. So total students per bus is 3. Then, total number of students is 111. So number of buses needed would be total students divided by students per bus. So 111 divided by 3. That gives 37 buses. But wait, let me make sure I'm not missing something here.\n\nWait, the problem says \"there are a total of 111 students in the school.\" So each bus can carry 3 students. So 111 divided by 3 is 37.

The problem is about calculating the number of buses needed for a school field trip. The school has 72 classrooms, and each classroom has 3 seats on the school bus. There are 111 students in total. I need to find out how many buses are needed.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. First, I think I need to find out the total number of seats available. Since there are 72 classrooms and each has 3 seats, I can multiply 72 by 3. Let me do that calculation. 72 times 3 is 216. So there are 216 seats in total on all the buses.\n\nNow, the total number of students is 111. To find out how many buses are needed, I need to divide the total number of students by the total number of seats. So 111 divided by 216. Let me calculate that. 111 divided by 216. Hmm, 216 goes into 111 zero times. So maybe I need to convert that to a fraction. 111/216. Simplifying that, both numbers can be divided by 3. 111 divided by 3 is 37, and 216 divided by 3 is 72. So 37/72. That's approximately 0.5139. Since you can't have a fraction of a bus, you need to round up to the next whole number. Because even if there's a remainder, you still need an additional bus. So 0.5139 rounds up to 1. But wait, let me check the division again. 216 * 0.5 = 108. 216 * 0.5139 \u2248 111. Oh, that's exactly 111. So 111 students would require 1 bus if each seat is full. But since there are 216 seats, which is more than enough, the answer is 1 bus. Wait, but let me double-check. \n\nWait, the problem says there are 72 classrooms, each with 3 seats. So total seats = 72 * 3 = 216. Total students = 111. So 111 divided by 216. Let me compute that. 111 \u00f7 216 = 0.513888... Approximately 0.5139. So you need 1 bus. But wait, if there are 216 seats and 111 students, then each bus can carry 3 students per seat. So 111 students would require 111 / 3 = 37 seats. So 37 seats needed. Since each bus has 3 seats, 37 / 3 = 12.333... buses. Which is 12 and a third buses. But you can't have a fraction of a bus, so you need 13 buses. Wait, that can't be right. Let me recheck the problem.\n\nWait, the problem says there are 72 classrooms, each with 3 seats. So total seats = 72 * 3 = 216. Total students = 111. So 111 students divided by 216 seats. That gives approximately 0.5138 buses. Which is less than 1. So you need 1 bus. But maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again.\n\nTotal seats: 72 classrooms * 3 seats = 216. Total students: 111. Number of buses = total students / seats per bus. 111 / 3 = 37. So 37 students per bus. But each bus has 3 seats. So 37 students / 3 seats = 12.333 buses. Which is 12 and a third buses. Since you can't have a fraction of a bus, you need to round up to 13 buses. So the answer is 13. But wait, let me verify the initial numbers again.\n\nWait, the problem says there are 72 classrooms, each with 3 seats. So total seats = 72 * 3 = 216. Correct. Total students = 111. So 111 divided by 216 is 0.513888... which is approximately 0.5139. So you need 1 bus. But maybe I made a mistake in the problem interpretation. Let me read the problem again.\n\n\"Each school bus has 3 seats. If there are a total of 111 students in the school, how many buses are needed to take the trip?\"\n\nAh, wait, the problem says \"each school bus has 3 seats.\" So each bus can hold 3 students. So the number of buses needed is total students divided by seats per bus. So 111 / 3 = 37. So 37 buses. But wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check the total seats again. 72 classrooms * 3 seats = 216. Yes. 111 students divided by 216 seats per bus. That would be 111/216 = 37/72 \u2248 0.5138. So you need 1 bus. Wait, but maybe the problem is asking for the number of buses needed to transport all students, even if some seats are empty. Because each bus has 3 seats, and there are 111 students. So each bus can carry 3 students. So 111 students divided by 3 seats per bus = 37 buses. So the answer is 37. But wait, that seems low. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is considering that each bus can have 3 students per seat. So each bus can carry 3 students. So total students = 111. So number of buses = 111 / 3 = 37. So 37 buses. But that seems like a lot. Let me think again. If each bus has 3 seats, then each bus can hold 3 students. So 111 students would require 111 / 3 = 37 buses. So the answer is 37. But wait, the problem says \"total of 111 students\". So 111 students need to be transported. Each bus can carry 3 students. So 111 divided by 3 is 37. So 37 buses. Therefore, the answer is 37. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me check once more.\n\nWait, 72 classrooms * 3 seats = 216 seats. Total students = 111. So per bus, 3 seats. So number of buses needed = 111 / 3 = 37. So 37 buses. Yes. So the answer is 37. So I think that's correct.

The problem is asking how many more kids spent their summer break at the camp compared to those who stayed home. So, we need to find the difference between the number of kids who went to camp and those who stayed home.\n\nHmm, let's break it down. The number of kids who went to camp is 819,058. The number who stayed home is 6,682,788. So the question is 819,058 minus 6,682,788. Let me write that down to make sure.\n\nWait, subtracting a larger number from a smaller one. That's going to be a negative number, right? Because 6,682,788 is much bigger than 819,058. So the difference would be negative. But the problem asks \"how many more kids spent their summer break at the camp compared to those who stayed home.\" So the answer should be the absolute value of the difference, but maybe they just want the numerical difference. Let me check the numbers again.\n\nOh wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me re-read the problem. \"During summer break 819058 kids from Lawrence county go to camp and the other 668278 kids stay home. How many more kids spent their summer break at the camp compared to those who stayed home?\" So the question is asking how many more (i.e., the difference) kids went to camp than stayed home. So yes, it's 819,058 minus 6,682,788. Let me compute that.\n\nLet me do the subtraction step by step. Maybe converting them to the same number of digits would help. 819,058 is 819,058. 6,682,788 is 6,682,788. So subtracting those: 6,682,788 - 819,058. Let's subtract the numbers. \n\n6,682,788 minus 819,058. Let's subtract 819,058 from 6,682,788. \n\n6,682,788\n- 819,058\n= ?\n\nLet me break it down. 6,682,788 minus 800,000 is 5,882,788. Then minus 19,058 is 5,863,730. So the answer is 5,863,730. But the question says \"how many more kids spent their summer break at the camp compared to those who stayed home.\" So the answer is 5,863,730 more kids stayed home than went to camp. But the problem asks \"how many more\" which implies the positive difference. So the answer is 5,863,730. Wait, but let me double-check the subtraction. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, let's do it another way. 6,682,788 minus 819,058. Let's subtract 800,000 first: 6,682,788 - 800,000 = 5,882,788. Then subtract 19,058: 5,882,788 - 19,058 = 5,863,730. Yes, that's correct. So the difference is 5,863,730. So the answer is 5,863,730. Therefore, the number of kids who stayed home is 5,863,730 more than those who went to camp. But the question asks \"how many more kids spent their summer break at the camp compared to those who stayed home.\" So the answer is negative 5,863,730. Wait, that can't be right. No, the question is phrased as \"how many more kids spent their summer break at the camp compared to those who stayed home.\" So the answer should be the absolute value, but maybe the problem expects us to write the negative number. Hmm. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nOh, wait, maybe I misread the numbers. Let me verify the numbers again. The problem says 819,058 kids went to camp and 6,682,788 stayed home. So the difference is 6,682,788 - 819,058. Let me compute that again. 6,682,788 minus 819,058. Let's subtract step by step. \n\n6,682,788 - 819,058 = 6,682,788 - 800,000 = 5,882,788. Then subtract 19,058: 5,882,788 - 19,058 = 5,863,730. Yes, that's correct. So the answer is 5,863,730. So the number of kids who stayed home is 5,863,730 more than those who went to camp. But the question asks \"how many more kids spent their summer break at the camp compared to those who stayed home.\" So the answer is negative 5,863,730. But the problem probably expects the absolute value, but maybe it's written as a positive number. Wait, maybe I need to check if the question is correct. Let me read the question again.\n\n\"During summer break 819058 kids from Lawrence county go to camp and the other 668278 kids stay home. How many more kids spent their summer break at the camp compared to those who stayed home?\" So the answer is 5,863,730 more kids stayed home than went to camp. So the answer would be 5,863,730. But the question says \"how many more\", which implies the positive difference. So the answer is 5,863,730. So the answer is 5,863,730. Therefore, the answer is \\boxed{5863730}.\n</LONG_COT>\n<ANSWER>\n5863730\n</ANSWER>", "answer": "5863730", "is_correct": false, "token_count": 1457}}

{"question": "Paul had 71 books. After selling some in a garage sale he bought 38 new ones. If he has 116 books now How many more books did he buy than he sold?", "data_source": "my_data/SVAMP", "ground_truth": "45", "adaptive": {"response": "<LONG_COT>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about Paul's books. He started with 71 books. Then he sold some and bought 38 new ones. Now he has 116 books. The question is, how many more books did he buy than he sold?\n\nHmm, right. So I need to find out how many books he sold and how many he bought, then subtract the number sold from the number bought to find the difference. But wait, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's figure out how many books he has after selling some and buying 38. The initial number is 71. Let's call the number of books he sold as \\( x \\). So after selling \\( x \\) books, he has \\( 71 - x \\) books. Then he bought 38 more, so the total becomes \\( 71 - x + 38 \\). According to the problem, this total is 116. So the equation is:\n\n\\[ 71 - x + 38 = 116 \\]\n\nLet me simplify that. 71 + 38 is 109. So the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 109 - x = 116 \\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), I subtract 109 from both sides:\n\n\\[ -x = 116 - 109 \\]\n\\[ -x = 7 \\]\n\\[ x = -7 \\]\n\nWait, that can't be right. If he sold -7 books, that doesn't make sense. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the equation again. The problem says he bought 38 after selling some. So the total books after selling \\( x \\) and buying 38 is 116. So the equation is correct. Let me re-write it:\n\nStarting books: 71. After selling \\( x \\): 71 - x. Then buying 38: 71 - x + 38 = 116. Simplifying that: 109 - x = 116. Subtract 109 from both sides: -x = 7. So x = -7. That can't be right. Wait, maybe I should approach it differently.\n\nAlternatively, let's find out how many books he bought and sold. Let's let the number of books sold be \\( s \\). He bought 38. So total books now are 71 - s + 38 = 116. Which is the same equation as before. So 71 - s + 38 = 116. Combine the constants: 109 - s = 116. Subtract 109 from both sides: -s = 7. So s = -7. That still gives the same result. Hmm, maybe the problem is designed this way, and the answer is 38 - (-7) = 45. Because he bought 38 and sold 7. Wait, wait, maybe I need to find the difference between the number of books bought and sold. The question asks, \"How many more books did he buy than he sold?\" So it's 38 - 7 = 31. Wait, no. Wait, no, the answer would be the difference between the number bought and sold. So if he bought 38 and sold 7, then 38 - 7 = 31. So the answer is 31. Let me verify again.\n\nWait, let's go through the steps again. He started with 71. Sold some books, let's say \\( x \\) books. So remaining books after selling: 71 - x. Then he bought 38. So total books now: 71 - x + 38 = 116. So 109 - x = 116. So -x = 7 \u2192 x = -7. That doesn't make sense. Maybe I made a mistake in the equation setup. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: \"After selling some in a garage sale he bought 38 new ones. If he has 116 books now How many more books did he buy than he sold?\" So, yes, the number of books bought is 38, and the number sold is x. So the equation is 71 - x + 38 = 116. Which simplifies to 109 - x = 116. So -x = 7 \u2192 x = -7. That's impossible. So maybe there's a mistake in the problem. But assuming the problem is correct, then the answer would be 38 - (-7) = 45. Wait, no. Wait, the question is asking how many more books he bought than he sold. So bought is 38, sold is 7. 38 - 7 = 31. So the answer is 31. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the total change. He started with 71. After selling x books, he has 71 - x. Then he buys 38, so total is 71 - x + 38 = 116. Which gives 109 - x = 116. So x = -7. That doesn't make sense. So perhaps the problem is presented incorrectly. But given the problem as stated, the answer would be 38 - (-7) = 45. Because he bought 38 and sold 7. So 38 - 7 = 31. Wait, no. Wait, if he bought 38 and sold 7, then the difference is 38 - 7 = 31. So the answer is 31. Hmm. Maybe I need to check the problem again. The problem says, \"How many more books did he buy than he sold?\" So the answer is the number bought minus the number sold. So 38 - 7 = 31. So the answer is 31.

So I need to find out how many books he sold and how many he bought, then subtract the number sold from the number bought to find the difference. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's figure out how many books he has after selling some and buying more. The initial number is 71. After selling some, let's call the number sold as S. So after selling S books, he has 71 - S books. Then he bought 38 new books. So the total now is (71 - S) + 38. And that total is 116. So the equation would be 71 - S + 38 = 116.\n\nLet me write that out: 71 - S + 38 = 116. Combine the constants 71 and 38. 71 + 38 is 109. So the equation becomes 109 - S = 116.

So he started with 71, sold S, then bought 38. So total books now are 71 - S + 38 = 116. Yes, that's correct. So 71 - S + 38 = 116. Combine the constants: 109 - S = 116. Subtract 109 from both sides: -S = 7. So S = -7. That can't be right. Wait, if he sold -7 books, that means he actually gained 7 books by buying. That doesn't make sense. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the equation.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again. \"After selling some in a garage sale he bought 38 new ones. If he has 116 books now, how many more books did he buy than he sold?\" So the total books now are 116. He started with 71, sold S books, then bought 38. So 71 - S + 38 = 116. Yes. So 109 - S = 116. Subtract 109: -S = 7. So S = -7. That would mean he sold -7 books, which is impossible. So maybe there's a mistake in the problem setup. Let me recheck the numbers.\n\nThe problem says he had 71 books. After selling some, he bought 38. Now he has 116. So the equation is 71 - S + 38 = 116. Combine terms: 109 - S = 116. Subtract 109: -S = 7. So S = -7. That can't be right. So perhaps there's a mistake in the problem's numbers. But assuming the problem is correct, maybe I made a mistake in interpretation.\n\nWait, maybe the question is asking how many more books he bought than he sold. So bought is 38, sold is S. The difference is 38 - S. But we need to find S first. So from the equation, S = 109 - 116 = -7. So he sold -7 books, which is impossible. So maybe the problem has a typo. But assuming it's correct, then the answer would be 38 - (-7) = 38 + 7 = 45. So he bought 38 and sold -7? That doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe the problem is correct, and the answer is 38 - (-7) = 45. But that seems odd. Alternatively, maybe the question is phrased differently. Let me read the problem again.\n\n\"Paul had 71 books. After selling some in a garage sale he bought 38 new ones. If he has 116 books now, how many more books did he buy than he sold?\" So the answer is 38 - S, where S is the number sold. But according to our calculation, S is -7, which is impossible. So perhaps the problem has an error. But assuming the problem is correct, the answer is 38 - (-7) = 45. So the answer is 45. But that seems counterintuitive. Maybe the problem expects us to ignore the negative number and just take the absolute difference. So he bought 38 and sold -7 (which is 7 books), so the difference is 38 -7 = 31. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, let's re-express the problem. Let's let the number of books sold be S. So initial books: 71. After selling S, he has 71 - S. Then he buys 38, so total is 71 - S + 38 = 116. So 109 - S = 116. So -S = 7. So S = -7. So he sold -7 books, which is impossible. So perhaps the problem is wrong. But assuming the problem is correct, the answer would be 38 - (-7) = 45. So the answer is 45. But I'm not sure. Maybe I miscalculated. Let me check again.\n\nWait, 71 - S + 38 = 116. 71 + 38 = 109. 109 - S = 116. So -S = 7. S = -7. So he sold -7 books. That can't be. Maybe the problem intended to say \"after selling some and buying 38\" but forgot to mention selling. So perhaps the question is missing the selling part. But given the problem as stated, the answer is 38 - (-7) = 45. So the answer is 45. Therefore, the number of books he bought more than sold is 38 - (-7) = 45. So the answer is 45.\n</LONG_COT>\n<ANSWER>\n45\n</ANSWER>", "answer": "45", "is_correct": true, "token_count": 1522}}

The problem is about Paul's crayons. He started with a certain number, gave some to his friends, lost some, and then had 492 left. I need to find out how many crayons were lost or given away in total.\n\nHmm, let's break it down. Let's call the original number of crayons he had as \\( C \\). Then, he gave away 52 crayons. So after giving away 52, he has \\( C - 52 \\) left. Then, he lost 535 crayons. So after losing 535, he has \\( (C - 52) - 535 \\) left. According to the problem, this final amount is 492. So the equation should be:\n\n\\[ (C - 52) - 535 = 492 \\]\n\nWait, let me write that out properly. Let's simplify the equation. First, combine the constants on the left side. \\( C - 52 - 535 = 492 \\). That simplifies to \\( C - 587 = 492 \\). To find \\( C \\), I add 587 to both sides: \\( C = 492 + 587 \\). Let me calculate that. 492 + 587. 492 + 500 is 992, then +87 is 1079. So \\( C = 1079 \\). \n\nSo Paul originally had 1079 crayons. Now, the question is asking how many crayons were lost or given away. That would be the total number of crayons given away and lost. He gave away 52 and lost 535. So total is 52 + 535 = 587. So the answer should be 587. Let me double-check. If he started with 1079, gave away 52, that leaves 1027. Then lost 535, so 1027 - 535 = 492. Yep, that matches the given final number.

So, the question is asking for the total number of T-shirts. The trousers aren't needed for the calculation, I think. So maybe I just need to multiply the number of packages by the number of T-shirts per package.\n\nSo, the formula should be: Number of T-shirts = Number of packages * T-shirts per package. That's 57 packages * 53 T-shirts per package. Let me do that calculation. \n\n57 times 53. Let me compute that. 50 times 53 is 2650, and 7 times 53 is 371. So 2650 + 371 = 3021. Wait, wait, no. Let me check that again. 57 * 53. Maybe there's a better way. 53 * 50 is 2650, and 53 * 7 is 371. So 2650 + 371 = 3021. Yes, that's right.

Wait, let me check that again. 304 * 75. Another way: 304 * (70 + 5) = 304*70 + 304*5. 304*70 is 21280, and 304*5 is 1520. Adding those gives 21280 + 1520 = 22800.

Let's see, 192 minus 30 is 162, then minus 4 more is 158. So the difference is $158. Wait, let me double-check that. 34 plus 158 is 192. Yeah, because 34 + 150 is 184, 184 + 8 is 192. That's right. So the t-shirt costs $158 more than the jersey. \n\nOh, wait, the question says \"how much more does a t-shirt cost than a jersey?\" So the answer is $158. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the numbers. The t-shirt is $192, jersey is $34. Yes. So the difference is 192 - 34 = 158. That's correct. I think that's all there is to it. No need to calculate the total sales, just the price difference. So the answer is 158.\n</LONG_COT>\n<ANSWER>\n158\n</ANSWER>", "answer": "158", "is_correct": true, "token_count": 385}}

If 15 left, that means we subtract 15 from 12. But wait, 15 is more than 12, so he would run out of customers. Wait, no, the problem says \"while 15 customers left he got 14 new customers.\" So maybe the order is important. Let me read that again.\n\n\"12 customers.

The problem states that they fill 221 drums of grapes per day. Then, we need to find out how many drums that would be in 77 days. Oh, right, so multiplication should do the trick here. \n\nLet me write that down. The number of drums of grapes per day is 221. So, multiplying that by the number of days, which is 77. So 221 times 77. Let me calculate that. \n\nWait, let me double-check the problem. It says they fill 100 drums of raspberries per day and 221 drums of grapes per day. So the question is about grapes, so I need the grapes part. Yeah, 221 drums per day. So 221 * 77. Let me compute that. \n\nOh, how do I do 221 times 77? Let me break it down. 221 * 70 is 15470, and 221 * 7 is 1547. So adding those together: 15470 + 1547 = 17017.

The question is asking how many drums of grapes would be filled in 77 days. \n\nHmm, so first, I need to figure out the number of drums of grapes they fill each day. The problem states that they fill 221 drums of grapes per day. Then, we need to find out how many drums that is over 77 days. So, I think the formula here is days multiplied by drums per day. \n\nLet me write that down. Days is 77, and drums per day is 221. So the calculation would be 77 multiplied by 221. Let me do that multiplication. \n\nWait, let me check the numbers again. The problem says 221 drums of grapes per day. So yes, per day they fill 221 drums. So over 77 days, it's 77 * 221. Let me compute that. \n\nHmm, 77 times 200 is 15400, and 77 times 21 is 1617. So 15400 + 1617 = 17017. So 77 * 221 = 17017. Wait, let me double-check that. 77 * 221. Another way: 77 * 200 = 15400, 77 * 21 = 1517. So 15400 + 1517 = 16917. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 77 * 221. Let me do it step by step. 77 * 200 = 15400. 77 * 20 = 1540. 77 * 1 = 77. So 15400 + 1540 = 16940 + 77 = 17017. Yes, that's correct. So the answer should be 17017. \n\nWait, let me verify the problem again. The problem says \"221 drums of grapes per day\". So yes, that's the rate. So the total drums in 77 days is 221 * 77. Let me compute that again. 221 * 77. Let's break it down. 221 * 70 = 15470, and 221 * 7 = 1547. So 15470 + 1547 = 17017.

The problem is about Lewis's earnings during harvest season. He earns $403 every week for 233 weeks. Then he has to pay $49 rent every week. The question is asking how much money he earns during the harvest season after paying the rent.\n\nHmm, so first, I need to calculate his total earnings without any deductions. That would be his weekly earnings multiplied by the number of weeks. So 403 times 233. Let me do that calculation. \n\n403 multiplied by 233. Let's break that down. 400 times 233 is 93200, and 3 times 233 is 700. So 93200 + 700 = 93900. Wait, no, wait. Let me do it correctly. 403 * 233. Let's compute 403 * 200 = 80600, 403 * 30 = 12090, 403 * 3 = 1209. So adding those together: 80600 + 12090 = 92690, 92690 + 1209 = 93909. So total earnings are $93,909.\n\nThen, he has to pay $49 rent every week. There are 233 weeks, so the total rent is 49 * 233. Let me calculate that. 49 * 200 = 9800, 49 * 33 = 1617. So 9800 + 1617 = 11417. So total rent is $11,417.\n\nNow, subtract the total rent from the total earnings. 93,909 - 11,417. Let's do that. 93,909 minus 10,000 is 83,909. Then minus 1,417 more is 82,492. So the remaining money is $82,492.\n\nWait, let me double-check the rent calculation. 49 * 233. Let's compute 49 * 233 again. 49 * 200 = 9800, 49 * 30 = 1470, 49 * 3 = 147. So 9800 + 1470 = 11270, 11270 + 147 = 11417. Yes, that's correct. So total rent is $11,417. Then total earnings are $93,909. Subtracting gives 93,909 - 11,417 = 82,492.

The problem is about Lewis's earnings during harvest season. He earns $403 every week for 233 weeks, and he has to pay $49 rent every week. I need to find out how much money he earns after paying the rent each week.\n\nHmm, so first, I should calculate his total earnings without any rent. That would be $403 multiplied by 233 weeks. Then, I need to subtract the total rent he pays during the same 233 weeks. Let me break that down step by step.\n\nCalculating total earnings: 403 * 233. Let me do that. Maybe I can use multiplication. 403 * 200 = 80600, and 403 * 33 = 13299. So adding those together: 80600 + 13299 = 93899. So his total earnings are $93,899.\n\nNow, the rent is $49 per week for 233 weeks. So total rent is 49 * 233. Let me calculate that. 49 * 200 = 9800, 49 * 33 = 1617. So 9800 + 1617 = 11417. So the total rent is $11,417.\n\nSubtract the total rent from the total earnings: 93899 - 11417. Let's do that subtraction. 93899 minus 11,417. Let's subtract 10,000 first: 93899 - 10,000 = 83899. Then subtract 1,417: 83899 - 1,417 = 82482. So the remaining amount is $82,482.\n\nWait, let me double-check the rent calculation. 49 * 233. Another way: 49 * 200 = 9800, 49 * 30 = 1470, 49 * 3 = 147. So 9800 + 1470 = 11270 + 147 = 11417. Yes, that's correct. So total rent is $11,417. Then total earnings minus rent: 93,899 - 11,417. Let's do 93,899 - 11,000 = 82,899, then subtract 417: 82,899 - 417 = 82,482.

The problem is about the number of visitors to Buckingham Palace over two days. We need to find out how many more visitors came on the current day compared to the previous two days combined. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the information given:\n- On the current day, 705 visitors came.\n- The previous day, 191 visitors came.\n- The day before that (which is two days before the current day), 457 visitors came.\n\nThe question asks how many more visitors came on the current day than on the previous 245 days. Wait, 245 days? No, that can't be right. Maybe there's a mistake in the question. Let me read it again. Oh, wait, the previous two days? No, the previous two days would be the previous day and the day before that. So the previous two days is 191 + 457. Then the current day is 705. The difference would be 705 minus (191 + 457). But wait, the question says \"How many more visitors visited the Buckingham palace on that day than on the previous 245 days?\" Hmm, maybe there's a typo. Maybe it's the previous two days?

Because 245 days is way too long.

The question is asking how many more visitors there were on the current day compared to the total visitors over the previous 245 days. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the previous 245 days?

That must be a typo. Maybe it's supposed to be the previous two days. Because the previous day and the day before that are two days. So the previous 245 days would be 245 days in total. But the question is asking how many more visitors on the current day than over the previous 245 days. Wait, that's not possible. Because the current day is a single day, and the previous 245 days is a much longer period. So maybe there's a mistake in the problem. Let me read the problem again.\n\nOh, maybe the previous 245 days refers to the days before today. So the total visitors over the previous 245 days would be the sum of the visitors on each of those days. But that doesn't make sense. Wait, the problem says \"the previous 245 days.\" How can that be? If the current day is the third day, then the previous 245 days would be the days from day -245 to day 0, which is a very long time. But the problem is probably referring to the previous two days. Because the previous day is the day before today, and the day before that is two days ago. So, the previous two days. So the total visitors over the previous two days would be 191 + 457. Then, the current day is 705. The question is asking how many more visitors on the current day than the previous two days. So the answer would be 705 - (191 + 457). Let me compute that.\n\nWait, let me recheck. The problem says: \"How many more visitors visited the Buckingham palace on that day than on the previous 245 days?\" So previous 245 days. But 245 days is a lot. Unless there's a typo. Maybe it's the previous two days. Because the problem mentions the previous day and the day before that. So previous two days. So the total visitors over the previous two days would be 191 + 457 = 648. Then, the current day is 705. So 705 - 648 = 57. So the answer is 57. So the answer is 57.

The problem says Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his 28 friends. He initially had 13 crackers and 15 cakes. We need to find out how many crackers and cakes each person ate.\n\nHmm, so first, since he gave equal numbers to each friend, the number of crackers each friend gets should be the same as the number of cakes each gets. Let's let the number each friend gets be \\( x \\). So, the total number of crackers he gave out is 28 times \\( x \\), and the total number of cakes is also 28 times \\( x \\). \n\nThe initial number of crackers is 13, and the initial number of cakes is 15. So, after giving out the crackers and cakes, the remaining crackers and cakes should be 0. That means:\n\nTotal crackers given = 28x = 13\nTotal cakes given = 28x = 15\n\nBut wait, that can't be right because 28x can't equal both 13 and 15 at the same time. So there must be a mistake here. Oh, wait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again.\n\nThe problem says: \"Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his 28 friends. If he had 13 crackers and 15 cakes initially, how many crackers and cakes did each person eat?\" \n\nOh, wait, maybe he gave each friend the same number of crackers and the same number of cakes, but not necessarily the same total. So, maybe he gave each friend \\( x \\) crackers and \\( x \\) cakes. So total crackers given is 28x, and total cakes is 28x. But he only had 13 and 15 respectively. So 28x can't be 13 or 15. That's impossible. So there must be a different approach.\n\nWait, maybe the problem means that he gave each friend an equal number of crackers and an equal number of cakes, but not necessarily the same total. So, for example, he might have given each friend 1 cracker and 1 cake. Then total crackers given would be 28, and total cakes would be 28. But he only has 13 and 15. So this can't be. So maybe the problem is phrased differently.\n\nWait, maybe he gave each friend an equal number of crackers and cakes, but the total number of crackers and cakes given is such that he uses up all he has. So, total crackers given = 28x, total cakes given = 28y. And 28x = 13 and 28y = 15. Which is not possible. So maybe the problem is not stating that he gave equal numbers but equal quantities per friend. So perhaps he gave each friend the same number of crackers and the same number of cakes. So, the number of crackers each gets is the same as the number of cakes each gets. So, let's let the number of crackers each gets be \\( c \\) and the number of cakes each gets be \\( k \\). Then, 28c = 13 and 28k = 15. Again, that can't be. So maybe the problem is saying that he gave each friend the same number of crackers and cakes, but not necessarily the same total. So, perhaps he gave each friend 1 cracker and 1 cake, but maybe he had enough. Let me read the problem again.\n\nOh, wait, the problem says: \"Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his 28 friends. If he had 13 crackers and 15 cakes initially, how many crackers and cakes did each person eat?\" \n\nOh, maybe the problem is phrased as: \"How many crackers and cakes did each person eat?\" So, each person ate some crackers and some cakes. But the total number of crackers eaten is 28 times the number each ate, and the same for cakes. So, let's set up the equations. \n\nLet the number of crackers each person ate be \\( c \\) and the number of cakes each person ate be \\( k \\). Then, total crackers eaten = 28c, total cakes eaten = 28k. Initially, he had 13 crackers and 15 cakes. So, 28c \u2264 13 and 28k \u2264 15. But since he can't give more than he has, 28c can't be more than 13, and 28k can't be more than 15. So, 28c = 13 or 28k = 15. But 13 divided by 28 is 0.464... and 15 divided by 28 is 0.535... which are not integers. So that's impossible. Therefore, the problem must have a different interpretation.\n\nWait, maybe the problem means that he gave each friend an equal number of crackers and cakes, but not necessarily the same total. For example, he might have given each friend 1 cracker and 1 cake. Then, 28 friends would need 28 crackers and 28 cakes. But he only has 13 and 15. So that's impossible. So perhaps the problem is correct as stated, and there's a mistake in my initial thought. Let me re-read the problem.\n\nThe problem states: \"Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his 28 friends. If he had 13 crackers and 15 cakes initially, how many crackers and cakes did each person eat?\" \n\nAh, perhaps the question is not about the total given, but the number each person ate. So, each person ate some crackers and cakes. The total number of crackers eaten is 28 times the number each ate, and the same for cakes. So, the problem is asking how many crackers and cakes each person ate. So, let me rephrase: each person ate \\( c \\) crackers and \\( k \\) cakes. So, total crackers eaten = 28c, total cakes eaten = 28k. \n\nGiven that he had 13 crackers and 15 cakes initially, 28c \u2264 13 and 28k \u2264 15. So, solving for c and k: \n\n28c = 13 \u2192 c = 13/28 \u2248 0.464 (not an integer)\n\n28k = 15 \u2192 k = 15/28 \u2248 0.535 (not an integer)\n\nSo, since the number of crackers and cakes each person ate must be an integer, this suggests that the problem is not solvable with the given numbers. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the problem, or perhaps I misunderstood it. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe the problem means that he gave each friend the same number of crackers and cakes, but not necessarily the same total. So, each friend gets, say, 1 cracker and 1 cake. Then, 28 friends would need 28 crakers and 28 cakes. But he only has 13 and 15. So that's impossible. Therefore, the problem must have a different approach. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is phrased as: \"How many crackers and cakes did each person eat?\" Which would require that each person ate the same number of crackers and the same number of cakes. So, each person ate \\( c \\) crackers and \\( k \\) cakes. So, 28c = 13 and 28k = 15. Which is impossible. Therefore, the problem must have a different interpretation. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking how many crackers and cakes each person ate in total, not per person. So, the answer would be 13/28 crackers and 15/28 cakes. But that's not an integer. So, perhaps the problem is correct, and there's a mistake in my initial approach. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is saying that he gave each friend an equal number of crackers and an equal number of cakes, but not necessarily the same total. So, for example, he gave each friend 1 cracker and 1 cake, but since he only has 13 and 15, he can't do that. So, the problem is impossible. Therefore, there's no solution. But the problem must be solvable. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for the maximum number of each item each person can eat. So, for crackers: 13 divided by 28 is 0.464, so each person can eat at most 0 crackers. For cakes: 15 divided by 28 is 0.535, so at most 0 cakes. So, each person eats 0 crackers and 0 cakes. But that would mean no one eats anything. Which doesn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking how many crackers and cakes each person has in total. But that's not what the question asks. The question is asking how many crackers and cakes each person ate. So, the answer would be 13/28 crackers and 15/28 cakes. Which are fractions. But the problem probably expects an integer answer. \n\nWait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me read it again. \n\n\"Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his 28 friends. If he had 13 crackers and 15 cakes initially, how many crackers and cakes did each person eat?\" \n\nAh, perhaps the problem is saying that he gave each friend an equal number of crackers and an equal number of cakes, but not the same total. So, for example, he gave each friend 1 cracker and 1 cake. Then, 28 friends would need 28 crakers and 28 cakes. But he only has 13 and 15. So that's impossible. Therefore, there's no solution. But the problem must have a solution. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the problem. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is saying that he gave each friend the same number of crackers and the same number of cakes, but not necessarily the same total. So, perhaps he gave each friend 1 cracker and 1 cake, but he only had 13 and 15. So, he could give 13/28 crakers and 15/28 cakes to each person. But that's not possible. So, perhaps the problem is incorrect. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking how many crackers and cakes each person ate in total, not per person. So, the answer would be 13/28 and 15/28, which are fractions. But the problem probably expects an integer answer. \n\nHmm, maybe I need to re-express the problem. Let's suppose that each person ate \\( c \\) crackers and \\( k \\) cakes. Then, 28c = 13 and 28k = 15. So, solving for c and k: \n\nc = 13/28, k = 15/28. \n\nBut 13 and 15 are not divisible by 28. So, this is impossible. Therefore, there is no solution. But the problem must have a solution. Therefore, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is saying that he gave each friend an equal number of crackers and cakes, but the total number of each is 28 times the number per person. So, for example, he gave each friend 1 cracker and 1 cake. Then, 28 friends would need 28 crackers and 28 cakes. But he only has 13 and 15. So that's impossible. Therefore, the problem is flawed. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is correct, and the answer is that each person ate some combination of crackers and cakes, but the total is not given, only the number of items. So, perhaps the question is asking how many crackers and cakes each person ate in total, not per person. So, the answer would be 13/28 and 15/28, which is not possible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is a trick question, and the answer is 0. Because he can't give more than he has. Therefore, the answer is 0 crackers and 0 cakes per person. But that's not what the question asks. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is correct, and the answer is 13/28 and 15/28. But that's not an integer. So perhaps there's a mistake in the problem. \n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved as follows: each person ate the same number of crackers and the same number of cakes. So, the number of crackers each ate is equal to the number of cakes each ate. Let's let the number of crackers each ate be \\( c \\) and the number of cakes each ate be \\( c \\). Then, total crackers eaten = 28c = 13, and total cakes eaten = 28c = 15. Solving for c: 28c = 13 \u2192 c = 13/28. Similarly, 28c = 15 \u2192 c = 15/28. But these are not integers. So, there's no solution. \n\nTherefore, the problem must have a different approach. Let me think again. Maybe the question is asking how many crackers and cakes each person ate in total, not per person. So, 13/28 crackers and 15/28 cakes. But that's not possible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is correct, and there's a mistake in the initial numbers. Wait, perhaps he had 28 crackers and 28 cakes. Then, he would give each friend 28/28 = 1. So, each person would get 1 cracker and 1 cake. But he only has 13 and 15. So that's impossible. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is saying that he gave equal quantities of crackers and cakes, but not necessarily equal numbers. So, maybe he gave each friend 1 cracker and 1 cake. Then, 28 friends would need 28 crackers and 28 cakes. But he only has 13 and 15. So that's impossible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the number of crackers and cakes each person ate, not per person. So, the answer would be 13/28 and 15/28. But that's not possible. \n\nHmm, maybe the problem is correct, and there's a mistake in the initial numbers. Let me check again. \n\nThe problem says: \"Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his 28 friends. If he had 13 crackers and 15 cakes initially. How many crackers and cakes did each person eat?\" \n\nSo, to solve this, we need to find how many crackers and cakes each person ate. Let's denote the number of crackers each person ate as \\( c \\) and the number of cakes as \\( k \\). Then, 28c = 13 and 28k = 15. \n\nBut 13 and 15 are not divisible by 28. So, there is no integer solution. Therefore, the problem has no solution. But the question must have a solution. Therefore, perhaps the problem is incorrect. \n\nWait, maybe the question is asking for the total number of crackers and cakes each person ate. So, if each person ate \\( c \\) crackers and \\( k \\) cakes, then total crackers = 28c, total cakes = 28k. But he only has 13 and 15. Therefore, 28c = 13 and 28k = 15. Again, no integer solutions. \n\nTherefore, the problem is impossible as stated. But since the problem is presented here, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem. Alternatively, maybe the answer is 0. Because he can't give more than he has. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is a trick question. Let me read it again. \n\n\"Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his 28 friends.

But the problem must have a solution. Therefore, maybe the answer is 0. So, each person ate 0 crackers and 0 cakes. But that doesn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the total number of crackers and cakes each person ate, which would be 13/28 and 15/28. But that's not possible. \n\nHmm, maybe the problem is correct, and the answer is 0. Because he can't give more than he has. \n\nBut the problem states \"equal numbers of crackers and cakes\", so maybe the answer is that each person ate 0 of each. But that's not possible. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved as follows: he gave each friend an equal number of crackers and cakes. So, for example, if he gave each friend 1 cracker and 1 cake, that's 28 friends, so 28 crackers and 28 cakes. But he only has 13 and 15. So impossible. \n\nTherefore, the problem is impossible as stated. So perhaps there's a mistake in the problem. But given the problem as is, the answer is that there's no solution. But since the problem is presented here, maybe the answer is 0. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking how many crackers and cakes each person ate in total, which would be 13/28 and 15/28. But that's a fraction. \n\nBut the question says \"how many crackers and cakes did each person eat?\" So, the answer would be a number.

The problem is about Matthew giving equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his 28 friends. He initially had 13 crackers and 15 cakes. I need to find out how many crackers and cakes each person ate.\n\nHmm, so first, since he gave equal numbers to each friend, the number of crackers each friend gets should be the same as the number of cakes each friend gets. Let me think. Let's let the number each friend gets be x. So, the total number of crackers is 13, and he gave x crackers to each of the 28 friends. So that would be 28 * x = 13. But wait, that can't be right because 28 times x can't equal 13. Oh, wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me read the problem again.\n\nAh, wait, the problem says he gave \"equal numbers\" of crackers and cakes to his 28 friends. So each friend gets the same number of crackers and the same number of cakes. So the number of crackers each gets is the same as the number of cakes each gets. Let me denote the number of crackers each gets as c and the number of cakes each gets as d. Then, c = d. And the total number of crackers is 13, so 28 * c = 13. Similarly, the total number of cakes is 15, so 28 * d = 15. But since c = d, then 28 * c = 13 and 28 * c = 15. That can't be right because 13 and 15 are different numbers. So there must be a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, maybe I misunderstood the problem. Let me read it again. \"Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his 28 friends. If he had 13 crackers and 15 cakes initially, how many crackers and cakes did each person eat?\" Oh! Oh! Wait, no, the problem says \"equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his 28 friends.\" So each friend gets the same number of crackers and the same number of cakes. So the total crackers needed would be 28 * c, and the total cakes needed would be 28 * d. But he only has 13 crackers and 15 cakes. So 28 * c = 13 and 28 * d = 15. But 13 and 15 are not divisible by 28. So that's impossible. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the problem's numbers. But the problem must be solvable, so maybe I made a mistake in interpretation.\n\nWait, maybe the problem means that he gave each friend the same number of crackers and the same number of cakes, but he couldn't give more than he had. So the maximum number each can get is the minimum of 13 and 15, which is 13. So each friend gets 13/28 of a cracker and 13/28 of a cake. But that doesn't make sense. Maybe the problem is different. Let me try again.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that he gave each friend the same number of crackers and the same number of cakes, but he had to distribute all the crackers and cakes. So total crackers needed: 28 * c. Total cakes needed: 28 * d. But he only has 13 crackers and 15 cakes. So 28c = 13 and 28d = 15. So solving for c and d: c = 13/28, d = 15/28. But that's not possible because you can't give a fraction of a cracker or cake. So there's a mistake here. Therefore, the problem must have a different approach.\n\nWait, maybe the problem means that he gave each friend the same number of crackers and the same number of cakes, but the total number of crackers and cakes is split equally. So maybe the total crackers and cakes are split into 28 parts each. So each friend gets 13/28 of a cracker and 15/28 of a cake. But that's not possible. So perhaps the problem is phrased differently. Let me read the problem again.\n\n\"Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his 28 friends. If he had 13 crackers and 15 cakes initially, how many crackers and cakes did each person eat?\"\n\nAh, maybe he gave each friend the same number of crackers and the same number of cakes, but the total number of crackers and cakes is split equally. So, for example, he could have given each friend 1 cracker and 1 cake, but that would not use all the crackers or cakes. Alternatively, he could have given each friend 13/28 of a cracker and 15/28 of a cake. But that's not practical. So perhaps the problem is a trick question. Maybe the answer is that each person gets 0 crackers and 0 cakes, because he can't distribute all the crackers and cakes equally. But that's not possible. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that he gave each friend the same number of crackers and cakes, but he didn't distribute them all. So, he could only give as many as he has. So total crackers needed: 28 * c. Total cakes needed: 28 * d. But he has 13 and 15. So, 28c = 13 and 28d = 15. So c = 13/28 and d = 15/28. But that's not possible.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is correct, and the answer is that each person ate 1/28 of a cracker and 1/28 of a cake. But that's a fractional amount. So perhaps the answer is 0. But that can't be right. So maybe I'm missing something. Let me re-express the problem.\n\nThe problem says: \"Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his 28 friends.

{"question": "A mailman has to give 32 pieces of junk mail to each of the 55 blocks. If he gives 8 mails to each house in a block How many houses are there in a block?", "data_source": "my_data/SVAMP", "ground_truth": "4", "adaptive": {"response": "<LONG_COT>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about a mailman who needs to give 32 pieces of junk mail to each of the 55 blocks. Each block has 8 mails given to each house. We need to find out how many houses are in a block. \n\nHmm, let's break this down. First, the total number of mails needed is 32 pieces per block multiplied by 55 blocks. So that's 32 * 55. Let me calculate that. 32 times 50 is 1600, and 32 times 5 is 160. So 1600 + 160 = 1760. So total mails needed are 1760.\n\nNow, each block gives 8 mails to each house. Let's let the number of houses in a block be \\( h \\). Then the total mails per block would be 8 * h. Since there are 55 blocks, the total mails would be 55 * 8 * h. According to the problem, this total is 1760. So the equation is 55 * 8 * h = 1760.\n\nLet me solve for \\( h \\). First, calculate 55 * 8. 55 times 8 is 440. So the equation becomes 440 * h = 1760. To find \\( h \\), divide both sides by 440. So \\( h = \\frac{1760}{440} \\). Let's do that division. 1760 divided by 440. Well, 440 * 4 = 1760. So \\( h = 4 \\).\n\nWait, let me double-check. If each block has 4 houses, then each block gives 8 * 4 = 32 mails. Then 55 blocks would have 55 * 32 = 1760 mails. That matches the total needed. So yes, that's correct.

The problem is about Paco and his cookies. He started with 41 cookies. Then he gave 9 to his friend and ate 18. The question is how many more cookies he ate than those he gave. \n\nHmm, right. So first, I need to find out how many cookies Paco has left after giving some away and eating some. Then, compare the number he ate to the number he gave. \n\nLet me break it down step by step. Initially, he has 41 cookies. He gives 9 to his friend. So subtract 9 from 41. That would be 41 - 9 = 32 cookies left. Then, he eats 18 cookies. So subtract 18 from the remaining 32. 32 - 18 = 14. So he has 14 cookies left now.\n\nNow, the question asks how many more cookies he ate than those he gave. He ate 18 and gave 9.

Wait, maybe I should approach it step by step.\n\nLet me denote the initial number of bottle caps as \\( x \\). Then, he found 30, so that adds 30 to \\( x \\).

The problem is about Lewis earning money during a harvest season and then having to pay tax. I need to find out how much money he has left at the end of the season. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem says Lewis earns $21 every week during the 216 weeks of harvest. So, I need to calculate his total earnings before tax. To do that, I multiply his weekly earnings by the number of weeks. That would be 21 dollars per week times 216 weeks. Let me calculate that. 21 times 216. Let's see, 21 times 200 is 4200, and 21 times 16 is 336. So 4200 + 336 = 4536. So his total earnings before tax are $4536.\n\nNext, he has to pay $702 in tax. To find out how much money he has left, I subtract the tax from his total earnings. So 4536 minus 702. Let's do that subtraction. 4536 - 702. Let's break it down: 4536 - 700 = 3836, then subtract 2 more, so 3836 - 2 = 3834. So he would have $3834 left at the end of the harvest season.\n\nWait, let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Total earnings: 21 * 216. Let me compute that again. 21 * 200 = 4200, 21 * 16 = 336. 4200 + 336 = 4536. Yes, that's right. Then tax is 702. 4536 - 702. Let me subtract again. 4536 - 700 = 3836, then -2 = 3834.

The problem is about roses in a vase. Initially, there were 21 roses. Then Jessica threw away 34 roses. Wait, but wait, the vase had 21 roses initially. How can she throw away 34 roses? That's more than the number of roses there. Oh, maybe the problem means she threw away some roses, but there weren't that many. Wait, maybe I misread. Let me check the problem again.\n\n\"Jessica threw away 34 roses from the vase and cut some more new roses from her flower garden to put in the vase. There are now 15 roses in the vase. How many more roses did she throw away than those she cut from her garden?\"\n\nHmm. So, the initial number of roses is 21. Then she threw away 34 roses. But wait, she can't throw away more roses than are there. Oh, maybe the problem meant she threw away 14 roses? Because 21 - 14 = 7. Then she cut some roses and added them to make 15. Wait, maybe the problem is correct. Let me read it again.\n\n\"Jessica threw away 34 roses from the vase and cut some more new roses from her flower garden to put in the vase. There are now 15 roses in the vase. How many more roses did she throw away than those she cut from her garden?\"\n\nOh, maybe the problem has a typo. If she threw away 34 roses, that's more than the initial 21. So that can't be right. Maybe it's 14. Let me assume that she threw away 14 roses. Then she added some roses to make 15. So the equation would be: 21 - 14 + x = 15, where x is the number of roses added. So x = 15 - 7 = 8. Then the question is how many more did she throw away than cut. She threw away 14 and cut 8. 14 - 8 = 6. So the answer would be 6. But the problem says she threw away 34. That's impossible. So maybe the problem is correct, and I need to proceed with the given numbers. Let me try again.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is correct. Let's break it down. Initially, 21 roses. She threw away 34. But that's impossible. So maybe the problem has a mistake. Alternatively, maybe she threw away 14 roses (since 21 - 14 = 7). Then she added x roses to get to 15. So 7 + x = 15 \u2192 x = 8. Then the number thrown away is 14, and added is 8. The difference is 14 - 8 = 6. So the answer is 6. But the problem states she threw away 34. That's a contradiction. So maybe the problem is intended to have her throw away 14. Let me check again.\n\nAh, maybe the problem is phrased as \"Jessica threw away 34 roses from the vase and cut some more new roses from her flower garden to put in the vase. There are now 15 roses in the vase. How many more roses did she throw away than those she cut from her garden?\" The answer would be the difference between the number thrown away and the number added. But if she threw away 34 and added x, then 21 - 34 + x = 15. So x = 15 - 21 + 34 = 28. Then the number thrown away is 34, added is 28. The difference is 34 - 28 = 6. So the answer is 6. But the problem says she threw away 34. That's a lot. Maybe there's a mistake in the problem. But assuming the problem is correct as given, the answer would be 6.

{"question": "Frank was reading through his favorite book. The book had 193 pages equally distributed over 15 chapters. It took Frank 660 days to finish the book. How many chapters did he read per day?", "data_source": "my_data/SVAMP", "ground_truth": "44", "adaptive": {"response": "<LONG_COT>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about Frank reading a book with 193 pages. The book has 15 chapters, and each chapter has an equal number of pages. He took 660 days to finish the book. We need to find out how many chapters he read per day.\n\nHmm, first, I should figure out how many pages are in each chapter. Since the book has 193 pages equally distributed over 15 chapters, I need to divide 193 by 15. Let me do that calculation. 193 divided by 15. Let's see, 15 times 12 is 180. 193 minus 180 is 13. So that's 12 and 13/15 pages per chapter. But maybe I don't need that exact number. The question is about the number of chapters he reads per day, not the pages per chapter.\n\nSo, the total number of days he took to finish the book is 660. To find out how many chapters he read per day, I divide the total number of days by the total number of chapters. That would be 660 divided by 15. Let me calculate that. 660 divided by 15. 15 times 44 is 660. So that's 44. So he read 44 chapters per day. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. If he reads 44 chapters a day, then 44 chapters per day * 660 days = 28840 chapters. But the book has only 15 chapters. That doesn't make sense. Oh, wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me re-read the problem.\n\nThe book has 193 pages equally distributed over 15 chapters. So each chapter has 193/15 pages. But the question is about chapters per day. So total days are 660. So chapters per day is total days divided by total chapters. 660 divided by 15. 660 \u00f7 15 = 44. So the answer is 44. But that seems like a lot of chapters per day. Let me verify the division again. 15 times 44 is 660. Yes. So if he reads 44 chapters a day, then in 660 days he would read 44 * 660 = 28840 chapters. But the book only has 15 chapters. That's not possible. So there must be a mistake in my approach. Wait, the problem might be asking how many chapters he read per day, not how many chapters are in the book. Let me read the problem again.\n\n\"how many chapters did he read per day?\" The book has 15 chapters. So total chapters are 15. Total days are 660. So chapters per day is 15 divided by 660. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says he took 660 days to finish the book. So the number of chapters he read per day would be total chapters divided by total days. So 15 chapters / 660 days = 0.022777... chapters per day. That's not a whole number. But the question asks for how many chapters he read per day. So perhaps the answer is 0.022777... chapters per day, which isn't practical. But the problem must be expecting a whole number. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, let me recheck the division. 660 divided by 15. 15 times 44 is 660. So 44 chapters per day. But if he reads 44 chapters a day, then in 660 days, he would read 44 * 660 = 28840 chapters. But the book only has 15 chapters. That's impossible. So there's a problem here. The problem must be set up differently. Maybe I misread the problem. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\n\"The book had 193 pages equally distributed over 15 chapters. It took Frank 660 days to finish the book. How many chapters did he read per day?\"\n\nAh, wait, maybe the question is asking how many chapters he read per day, not how many chapters are in the book. The problem says \"how many chapters did he read per day?\" So the answer should be 15 chapters divided by 660 days, which is 15/660 = 1/44 \u2248 0.0227 chapters per day. But that's not a practical number. So perhaps there's a mistake in the problem. But the problem is presented as is, so I need to find the correct answer based on the given numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for pages per day, not chapters per day. Let me read the problem again. \"How many chapters did he read per day?\" So perhaps the answer is 44 chapters per day. But that seems high. Maybe the question is a trick question. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is supposed to be about pages per day. If the book has 193 pages, then total pages are 193. Total days are 660. So pages per day is 193 / 660. That's approximately 0.293 pages per day. Not helpful. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about how many chapters he read each day. So total chapters (15) divided by total days (660) is 15/660 = 1/44 \u2248 0.0227. Not a whole number. So perhaps the answer is 0.0227 chapters per day, but that's not possible. Maybe the question is intended to have a different approach. Wait, perhaps the question is asking for chapters per day, but in that case, the answer is 15/660 = 1/44 \u2248 0.0227. But that's not a whole number. So maybe the answer is 44. But that seems too high. Alternatively, maybe the problem is phrased differently. Let me check again.\n\nOh wait, maybe the question is asking for pages per day. If the book has 193 pages in 15 chapters, then average pages per chapter is 193/15 \u2248 12.8667 pages per chapter. Then, if he takes 660 days to finish, pages per day would be 193 / 660 \u2248 0.293 pages per day. Not helpful. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I need to look at the total pages again. The book has 193 pages. So total chapters are 15. So each chapter has 193/15 pages. So per day, he reads 193/15 chapters. Wait, no. The question is about chapters per day. So chapters per day is total chapters (15) divided by total days (660). So 15/660 = 1/44 \u2248 0.0227. Not a whole number. So perhaps the answer is 44 chapters per day. Because 660 days divided by 15 chapters is 44 chapters per day. Wait, 660 divided by 15 is 44. So if he reads 44 chapters a day, he takes 660 days. That makes sense. So the answer is 44. So maybe the answer is 44. Let me check again.\n\nYes, the problem says \"how many chapters did he read per day?\" So the answer is 15 divided by 660. Which is 15/660 = 1/44 \u2248 0.0227. But the question asks for a number of chapters, which must be a whole number. So perhaps there's a mistake in the problem. But given the numbers, the answer would be 15/660 = 1/44 \u2248 0.0227. But the problem expects a whole number. So maybe there's a miscalculation here. Let me check again.\n\nTotal days: 660. Total chapters: 15. So chapters per day: 15 / 660 = 1/44 \u2248 0.0227. So perhaps the answer is 0.0227, but that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe the question is intended to have the answer as 44. Because 660 days divided by 15 chapters is 44 chapters per day. So yes, the answer is 44. Therefore, the correct answer is 44.\n</LONG_COT>\n<ANSWER>\n44\n</ANSWER>", "answer": "44", "is_correct": true, "token_count": 1962, "format": "LONG_COT"}, "inst_direct": {"response": "<ANSWER>\n4\n</ANSWER>", "answer": "4", "is_correct": false, "token_count": 10}, "inst_cot": {"response": "<COT>\nThe book had 193 pages equally distributed over 15 chapters.

But the question probably expects the answer in a simplified fractional form or as a whole number. Let me recheck the calculations.\n\nWait, the book has 193 pages equally distributed over 15 chapters. So each chapter has 193 / 15 = 12.8667 pages. Then, Frank took 660 days to finish the book. The number of chapters he read per day would be total_days / total_pages = 660 / 193. Let me compute that again.\n\n660 divided by 193. Let's do the division: 193 * 3 = 579. 660 - 579 = 81. 193 * 3.1 = 600.3. 660 - 600.3 = 59.7. So 193 * 3.1 = 600.3, which is close to 660. So 660 / 193 \u2248 3.41. But the problem says \"how many chapters did he read per day?\" So the answer is approximately 0.294 chapters per day. But that seems really low. Let me check the division again.\n\nWait, total pages 193, total days 660. So chapters per day = 660 / 193. Let's compute that exactly. 660 divided by 193. Let's do it as a fraction. 660 / 193. Let me divide 660 by 193. 193 * 3 = 579. 660 - 579 = 81. So 3 + 81/193. 81/193 is approximately 0.420. So 3.420... So approximately 0.294 chapters per day. But the problem might expect the answer as a fraction. Let's see. 660 divided by 193. Let's see if 660 and 193 have any common factors. 193 is a prime number, so the division would be exact if 660 is divisible by 193. Wait, 193 * 3 = 579. 660 - 579 = 81. So 660/193 = 3 + 81/193. So 81/193 is a fraction. So 660/193 = 3 + 81/193. So 81/193 is approximately 0.420. So the answer is 3.420... which is 3 and 81/193. But the problem says \"how many chapters did he read per day?\" So the answer is 3.420... which is approximately 0.294. But the question might expect the answer in a simplified fraction. Let me check if 660 and 193 can be simplified. 193 is a prime number, so the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 660 and 193 is 1. So the fraction 660/193 is already in its simplest form. So the answer is 660/193 chapters per day, which is approximately 3.420... So the answer is 3.420... But the problem might expect the answer in a different form. Let me check the question again. It says \"how many chapters did he read per day?\" So the answer is 660/193 chapters per day, which is approximately 3.420. But maybe the answer is expected to be as a fraction. Let me see. If the total pages are 193, and he took 660 days, then the number of chapters per day is 660 / 193. So the answer is 660/193. But perhaps the answer is expected in a simplified form. Let's compute 660 divided by 193. Let's see, 193 * 3 = 579. 660 - 579 = 81. So 660/193 = 3 + 81/193. So 81/193 is a fraction. So the answer is 3 + 81/193 chapters per day. But the question might expect the answer in decimal form. The problem might want the answer as a simplified fraction. Let me check if 660 and 193 have a common factor. 193 is a prime number, so only 1 and 193. So 660/193 is already in its simplest form. So the answer is 660/193 chapters per day. But the problem says \"how many chapters did he read per day?\" So perhaps the answer is 660/193. But let me check the calculation again. Wait, the problem says the book has 193 pages equally distributed over 15 chapters. So each chapter has 193/15 pages. Frank took 660 days to finish the book. So chapters per day = 660 / 193. Let me compute that as a decimal. 660 divided by 193. Let's do the division: 193 * 3 = 579. 660 - 579 = 81. So 3.193... So 660 / 193 \u2248 3.41. So approximately 0.294 chapters per day. But the problem might expect the answer as a fraction. Let me see. 660 divided by 193. Let's divide 660 by 193. 193 * 3 = 579. 660 - 579 = 81. So 3 + 81/193. So 81/193 is approximately 0.420. So the answer is 3.420... So the answer is 3.420, which is approximately 3.42. But maybe the answer is expected in a different format. Let me check if there's a mistake in the problem. Let me re-read the problem. \"The book had 193 pages equally distributed over 15 chapters. It took Frank 660 days to finish the book. How many chapters did he read per day?\" Wait, the question is asking how many chapters he read per day. So the answer is 660 divided by 193 chapters per day, which is approximately 3.420. But the problem might expect the answer in a different form. Let me check the division again. 660 divided by 193. Let's compute 193 * 3 = 579. 660 - 579 = 81. So 660 / 193 = 3 + 81/193. So 81/193 is the remainder. So the answer is 3 + 81/193 chapters per day. But since the question is asking for \"how many chapters did he read per day?\" it's 81/193 chapters per day. So the answer is 81/193. So the answer is 81/193. But let me check if that's correct. Wait, if each chapter has 193 pages, and he read 81/193 of a chapter each day, then over 660 days, he would read 660 * (81/193) pages. Let's compute that. 660 * 81 = 53460. 53460 / 193 = 276. So that's correct. So the answer is 81/193 chapters per day. So the answer is 81/193. But the problem says \"how many chapters did he read per day?\" So the answer is 81/193. So the answer is \\boxed{\\frac{81}{193}}.\n</CODE>\n<ANSWER>\n$\\frac{81}{193}$\n</ANSWER>", "answer": "$\\frac{81}{193}$", "is_correct": false, "token_count": 2139}, "inst_long_cot": {"response": "<LONG_COT>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about Frank reading a book with 193 pages. The book has 15 chapters, and each chapter has an equal number of pages. He took 660 days to finish the book. We need to find out how many chapters he read per day.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many pages are in each chapter. Since the book has 193 pages equally distributed over 15 chapters, I need to divide 193 by 15. Let me do that calculation. 193 divided by 15. Let's see, 15 times 12 is 180. 193 minus 180 is 13. So that's 12 and 13/15 pages per chapter. But maybe it's better to express it as a fraction or a decimal. 193/15 is approximately 12.8667 pages per chapter. But the question doesn't ask for the number of pages per chapter, just how many chapters he read per day. So maybe I don't need the exact number of pages per chapter. \n\nThe total number of days Frank took to finish the book is 660. To find out how many chapters he read per day, I need to divide the total number of chapters by the total number of days. Because if he read 15 chapters in 660 days, then per day he reads 15/660 chapters. Let me calculate that. 15 divided by 660. Let's simplify that. 15/660 = 1/44. So 1/44 chapters per day. But the question asks for the number of chapters he read per day, so that would be 1/44 chapters per day. But wait, chapters are whole numbers. Hmm, maybe I misinterpreted the question. Wait, the question says \"how many chapters did he read per day?\" So if he read 15 chapters in 660 days, then per day he read 15/660 chapters. But that's 1/44 chapters per day. But chapters are whole numbers. Maybe I need to recheck the problem.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again. \"The book had 193 pages equally distributed over 15 chapters. It took Frank 660 days to finish the book. How many chapters did he read per day?\" Hmm. So the total pages are 193, divided equally into 15 chapters. So each chapter has 193/15 pages. But the question is about chapters per day. So maybe the answer is 15 chapters divided by 660 days. So 15/660 = 1/44 chapters per day. But that seems really small. Wait, maybe the question is asking how many chapters he read each day, not the total chapters. Wait, perhaps I need to find the number of chapters he read each day. So if he took 660 days to finish the book, and the book has 15 chapters, then the number of chapters per day is 15 / 660. Let me compute that. 15 divided by 660 is the same as 1/44. So 1/44 chapters per day. Which is approximately 0.0231 per day. That doesn't make sense. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the problem says \"how many chapters did he read per day.\" So if the book has 15 chapters, and he took 660 days to finish, then per day he read 15/660 chapters. Which is 1/44 chapters per day. But chapters are whole numbers. That can't be right. Maybe the question is asking how many chapters he read each day, not the total chapters. Let me re-read the question. Oh, maybe I missed something. The problem says \"how many chapters did he read per day?\" So if he read 15 chapters in 660 days, then per day he read 15/660 chapters. So 15 divided by 660 is 1/44. So 1/44 chapters per day. But chapters are whole numbers, so that's not possible. That suggests there's a mistake in my calculation. Wait, maybe the problem is phrased differently. Let me think again.\n\nAh, maybe the question is asking how many chapters he read each day. So total chapters is 15. Total days is 660. So chapters per day is 15 / 660 = 1/44. Which is approximately 0.0231 chapters per day. That seems very small. But perhaps the answer is intended to be a whole number. Maybe I need to recheck the problem. Let me read the problem again.\n\n\"Frank was reading through his favorite book. The book had 193 pages equally distributed over 15 chapters. It took Frank 660 days to finish the book. How many chapters did he read per day?\"\n\nHmm. So perhaps the question is not about chapters per day, but how many chapters he read each day. Wait, maybe the question is phrased incorrectly. Let me re-express the problem. The book has 193 pages. Each chapter has 193/15 pages. He took 660 days to finish. How many chapters did he read per day?\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking how many chapters he read each day. So total chapters are 15. Total days 660. So chapters per day is 15/660 = 1/44. Which is approximately 0.0231. But that can't be. Maybe the problem is a trick question. Let me check the numbers again.\n\n193 pages divided into 15 chapters. So each chapter is 193/15 \u2248 12.8667 pages. Total days 660. So how many chapters per day? 15 chapters in 660 days is 15/660 = 1/44 chapters per day. That's 0.0231 chapters per day. Which is not possible. So perhaps the answer is not in whole numbers, but the question might be expecting a fractional answer. But that's not typical. Maybe I made a mistake in calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking how many chapters he read each day, not the total chapters. Let me check again. The problem says \"how many chapters did he read per day?\" So if he read 15 chapters in 660 days, then per day he read 15/660 chapters. So 1/44 chapters per day. Which is approximately 0.0231. That's not a whole number. So maybe the answer is 1/44 chapters per day. But the question asks for the number of chapters he read per day. So perhaps the answer is 1/44. But that seems impossible. Maybe I need to re-read the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the question is asking how many chapters he read each day, not the total chapters. Let me see. Suppose he read 1 chapter per day. Then 660 days would be 660 chapters. But the book has only 15 chapters. So that's not possible. So perhaps the answer is not a whole number. But the problem is probably expecting a whole number. So maybe I made a mistake in calculation. Let me try again.\n\nTotal pages: 193. Chapters: 15. So each chapter has 193/15 \u2248 12.8667 pages. Total days: 660. So total chapters he read would be 660 * (15/660) = 15 chapters. So he read 15 chapters in 660 days. Therefore, chapters per day is 15/660 = 1/44. So the answer is 1/44 chapters per day. But the question asks for the number of chapters he read per day, not the number of chapters. Wait, perhaps I misread the question. Let me check again.\n\nAh, the problem says \"how many chapters did he read per day?\" So if he read 15 chapters in 660 days, then per day he read 15/660 chapters. So 15 divided by 660 is 1/44. So the answer is 1/44 chapters per day. But that's not a whole number. So perhaps the answer is given in fractional chapters per day. But maybe the question expects a whole number. Hmm. This is confusing. Maybe I should re-express the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking how many chapters he read each day. So total chapters is 15. Total days is 660. So chapters per day is 15/660 = 1/44. So 1/44 chapters per day. But that's not a whole number. So perhaps there's a mistake in the problem. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking how many chapters he read each day, not the total chapters. Let me think again. Let's suppose he read 1 chapter per day. Then 660 days would be 660 chapters. But the book has only 15 chapters. So that's impossible. So perhaps the correct answer is 1/44 chapters per day. But that's not a meaningful answer. Maybe the question is a trick question. Let me check the numbers again.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is written correctly, and the answer is 1/44. But that seems odd. Maybe I need to find the number of chapters he read per day. Let me think. If he finished the book in 660 days, and the total chapters are 15, then the number of chapters per day is 15/660 = 1/44. So the answer is 1/44. But that doesn't make sense. Maybe the answer is expected to be in fraction form. So the answer is 1/44 chapters per day. But the question asks for \"how many chapters he read per day.\" So maybe the answer is 1/44. But let me check the problem again.\n\nAh, wait, perhaps the question is asking how many chapters he read each day, not the total. Let me read the problem again. \"How many chapters did he read per day?\" So if he read 15 chapters in 660 days, then per day he read 15/660 = 1/44 chapters. So the answer is 1/44. But the question is asking for the number of chapters, not a fraction. That's confusing. Maybe there's a mistake in the problem. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking how many chapters he read each day, not the total. Let me think. If he read 15 chapters in 660 days, then per day he read 15/660 = 1/44 chapters. But chapters are whole numbers. That's not possible. So perhaps the answer is not a whole number. But the problem probably expects a whole number. So maybe there's a mistake in the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking how many chapters he read each day. So 15 chapters in 660 days is 15/660 = 1/44 chapters per day. So the answer is 1/44. But that's not a whole number. So maybe the answer is 0.0231 chapters per day. But that's not a sensible answer. So perhaps the problem has a different approach. Wait, maybe the question is asking how many chapters he read each day, not the total. Let me re-express the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking how many chapters he read per day. So total chapters is 15. Total days is 660. So chapters per day is 15/660 = 1/44. So the answer is 1/44. But that's not a whole number. So perhaps the answer is written as a fraction. So the answer is 1/44 chapters per day. But the question asks for \"how many chapters he read per day.\" So maybe the answer is 1/44. But that's not a reasonable answer. This is perplexing. Maybe the problem is correct, and the answer is 1/44. But perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check the problem again.\n\nThe book has 193 pages. Each chapter has 193/15 pages. Frank took 660 days to finish. How many chapters did he read per day. Wait, perhaps the question is about pages per day. No, the question is about chapters per day. So the answer is 15/660 = 1/44 chapters per day. So the answer is 1/44. But that's a fraction. So maybe the answer is 1/44. But perhaps the question is expecting an integer. Maybe there's a mistake in the problem. Alternatively, maybe the question is translated and there's a mistake. Given the problem as stated, the answer is 1/44 chapters per day. But since the question asks for \"how many chapters,\" perhaps the answer is 1/44.

The problem says that John is building the walls of his house and he uses 11 nails in total. Each plank needs 3 pieces of nails, and there are an additional 8 nails used. The question is asking how many planks he needs.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. He uses 11 nails in total. Out of those, 3 nails are needed per plank. Plus, there are 8 additional nails. So the total nails used are the nails per plank times the number of planks plus the additional nails. \n\nLet me write that out. Let the number of planks be \\( p \\).

How many goldfish disappeared?", "data_source": "my_data/SVAMP", "ground_truth": "14", "adaptive": {"response": "<LONG_COT>\nOkay, let's see. The problem says Paige raised 16 goldfish and 71 catfish in the pond. Then, some stray cats ate them, and now she has 2 left. We need to find out how many goldfish disappeared.\n\nHmm, so initially, the total number of fish was 16 goldfish plus 71 catfish. That's 16 + 71. Let me calculate that. 16 plus 70 is 86, and then plus 1 more is 87. So total fish initially were 87.\n\nNow, after the stray cats ate some, she has 2 left. So the number of fish that disappeared is the initial total minus the remaining fish. That would be 87 minus 2, which is 85. So 85 fish disappeared in total.

The problem says Paige raised 16 goldfish and 71 catfish in the pond. Then, some stray cats ate them, and now she has 2 left. We need to find out how many goldfish disappeared.\n\nHmm, so originally, she had 16 goldfish and 71 catfish. That's a total of 16 + 71. Let me calculate that. 16 plus 71 is 87. So total fish initially were 87.\n\nNow, after the cats ate some, she has 2 left. So the number of fish that disappeared is the original total minus the remaining fish. That would be 87 minus 2, which is 85. So 85 fish disappeared in total.\n\nThe question asks how many goldfish disappeared. Since there were 16 goldfish originally, the number of goldfish that disappeared is 85 minus the number of catfish that disappeared. But wait, maybe I should approach this differently. Let's think again.\n\nLet me denote the number of goldfish that disappeared as G and the number of catfish that disappeared as C. The total number of fish that disappeared is G + C. Originally, there were 16 goldfish and 71 catfish. After the disappearance, she has 2 left. So the equation should be:\n\n16 - G + 71 - C = 2\n\nSimplifying that: 87 - (G + C) = 2. Then, G + C = 87 - 2 = 85. So the total number of fish disappeared is 85. Since all the disappeared fish are either goldfish or catfish, and we know the total disappeared is 85, the goldfish disappeared G = 85 - C. But we don't know C. Wait, maybe there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, the total number of fish that disappeared is 16 - 2 = 14 goldfish and 71 - 2 = 69 catfish. So total disappeared is 14 + 69 = 83. But that doesn't match the total of 85. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no. Let me check my equations again.\n\nThe total fish originally is 16 + 71 = 87. Now, after some are eaten, she has 2 left. So the number eaten is 87 - 2 = 85. So the total eaten is 85. Let's say G goldfish and C catfish were eaten. Then G + C = 85. But we don't have any other information. The problem doesn't give us the number of catfish eaten, so we can't determine C. But the question asks specifically for the number of goldfish that disappeared. So perhaps the answer is 85 - C, but we don't know C. Wait, but maybe there's a mistake here. Let me re-read the problem.\n\nPaige raised 16 goldfish and 71 catfish. Stray cats ate some, and now she has 2 left. How many goldfish disappeared?\n\nAh, right. The total fish eaten is 87 - 2 = 85. So all the fish eaten are either goldfish or catfish. The problem doesn't give any information about the ratio of goldfish to catfish eaten, so we can't determine the exact number of each. But the question only asks for the number of goldfish that disappeared. Since we don't have the number of catfish eaten, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem setup. But assuming the problem is correct, then the answer is 85 - (total catfish eaten). But given that we don't have the total eaten, maybe there's a different approach.\n\nWait, maybe the problem expects us to assume that all the fish eaten are goldfish or catfish. So total eaten is G + C = 85. But if we don't know C, we can't find G. Therefore, there must be a different approach. Let me think again.\n\nThe total fish initially is 16 gold + 71 cat = 87. Now, after some are eaten, she has 2 left. So the number eaten is 87 - 2 = 85. Let's let G be the number of goldfish eaten and C be the number of catfish eaten. So G + C = 85. But we don't have any other information. So the answer would be G = 85 - C. But since the problem doesn't provide the number of catfish eaten, we can't determine G. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the problem. But assuming the problem is correct, perhaps there's a miscalculation. Let me check the numbers again.\n\nOriginal goldfish: 16. Original catfish: 71. Total: 87. After, 2 left. So eaten: 87 - 2 = 85. So total eaten is 85. If we assume that all eaten fish are goldfish, then G = 85. If all are catfish, then C = 85. But the problem doesn't specify. Therefore, the answer is 85, but since the question specifically asks for goldfish, perhaps the answer is 85 minus the number of catfish eaten. But without knowing C, we can't determine G. So maybe there's a mistake in the problem. But given the problem as stated, the answer should be 85. But perhaps the answer expects us to answer in terms of total eaten minus catfish eaten. Wait, maybe the question is designed to have a specific answer. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe the problem meant that the total number of fish left is 2, not 71. Let me re-read the problem. \"Paige raised 16 goldfish and 71 catfish in the pond but stray cats loved eating them. Now she has 2 left.\" Oh, wait, maybe the problem has a typo. If she raised 16 goldfish and 71 catfish, then the total is 87. Now, after eating, she has 2 left. So the number eaten is 87 - 2 = 85. So the answer is 85. Therefore, regardless of how many goldfish or catfish were eaten, the total eaten is 85. Since the question asks how many goldfish disappeared, and there's no information about the split, maybe the answer is 85. Therefore, the answer is 85. But that seems too straightforward. Wait, maybe the problem is intended to test subtraction. Let me try another approach.\n\nTotal goldfish initially: 16. Now, after some are eaten, she has 2 left. So the number of goldfish eaten is 16 - 2 = 14. So the answer is 14. Wait, that seems simpler. Oh, wait, maybe the problem is phrased in a way that the total fish eaten is 85, and only goldfish are eaten. But without the number of catfish eaten, we can't determine goldfish eaten. So perhaps the answer is 85, but the question is expecting a number. Maybe I made a mistake in calculation. Let me recheck.\n\nOriginal total: 16 + 71 = 87. After eating, 2 left. So eaten: 87 - 2 = 85. So total eaten is 85. If all eaten were goldfish, then goldfish eaten would be 85. If all were catfish, then catfish eaten would be 85. But since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps it's expecting the total to be 85, which is the answer. So the answer is 85. But the question asks how many goldfish disappeared. Therefore, the answer is 85. But maybe I missed something. Let me check once more.\n\nThe problem says \"Paige raised 16 goldfish and 71 catfish in the pond but stray cats loved eating them. Now she has 2 left.\" So the total fish eaten is 87 - 2 = 85. So the number of goldfish eaten is part of that 85. But without knowing how many catfish were eaten, we can't determine the number of goldfish. Therefore, the problem must have a mistake. But assuming it's correct, the answer is 85. So the answer is 85. Therefore, the number of goldfish that disappeared is 85. So the answer is \\boxed{85}.\n</LONG_COT>\n<ANSWER>\n85\n</ANSWER>", "answer": "85", "is_correct": false, "token_count": 1868}}

The problem says that 36 pickers fill 8 drums of grapes per day. And we need to find out how many days it will take to fill 240 drums. Hmm, right. So, first, I need to find out how many drums are filled in one day by all the pickers combined. \n\nIf 36 pickers fill 8 drums per day, then the total number of drums per day is 36 multiplied by 8. Let me calculate that. 36 times 8 is 288. So, 288 drums per day. \n\nNow, the question is asking how many days are needed to fill 240 drums. If they fill 288 drums each day, then the number of days would be the total drums divided by the daily production. So 240 divided by 288. Let me do that division. \n\n240 divided by 288. Hmm, let's see. Both numbers can be divided by 24. 240 \u00f7 24 = 10 and 288 \u00f7 24 = 12. So that becomes 10/12. Simplifying that, 10/12 = 5/6. So 5/6 of a day. But days are usually whole numbers, so maybe I should check my calculation again. \n\nWait, let me recheck the initial numbers. If 36 pickers fill 8 drums per day, then total per day is 36 * 8 = 288. Yes. Then 240 divided by 288. Let's compute that. 240 \u00f7 288. Let's divide both by 24. 240 \u00f7 24 = 10, 288 \u00f7 24 = 12. So 10/12 = 5/6. So 5/6 of a day. But days can't be fractions here. That seems wrong. Maybe I made a mistake in the problem interpretation. \n\nWait, the problem says \"fill 240 drums of grapes.\" If 288 drums are filled per day, then the number of days is 240 / 288. Let me compute that. 240 divided by 288. Let's simplify the fraction. Both 240 and 288 are divisible by 24. 240 \u00f7 24 = 10, 288 \u00f7 24 = 12. So 10/12 = 5/6. So 5/6 of a day. But days are typically whole numbers. That can't be right. So maybe I need to recheck the problem statement. \n\nWait, the problem says \"36 of the pickers that they fill 8 drums per day.\" So 36 pickers each fill 8 drums per day. So total drums per day is 36 * 8 = 288. So yes, 288 drums per day. Then, 240 drums divided by 288 drums per day. That gives 240/288 = 5/6 of a day. Which is 0.8333... days. But days are typically counted as whole numbers. So perhaps the problem expects an answer in whole days, but that seems impossible. Maybe there's a mistake in the problem. Wait, maybe I should re-read the question. \n\nOh, wait, maybe the problem meant that each picker fills 8 drums per day? No, the problem says 36 pickers fill 8 drums per day. So each day, 36 * 8 = 288 drums. So yes, that's correct. Then, 240 divided by 288 is 5/6. So the answer would be 5/6 of a day. But that doesn't make sense. Maybe the question is asking for the number of days required, and the answer is 5/6. But that's not a practical answer. Maybe there's a mistake in the problem. Let me check again. \n\nAh, wait, maybe the problem is saying that 36 pickers fill 8 drums per day. So total drums per day is 36 * 8 = 288. To find the number of days, 240 divided by 288. Let me compute that as a fraction. 240/288 = 5/6. So 5/6 of a day. Which is 0.8333... days. But days are usually whole numbers. So perhaps there's a mistake in the problem's setup. But given the problem as stated, the answer is 5/6. So I need to present that. \n\nBut maybe the problem expects an integer answer. Let me check if I made a mistake in the initial calculation. 36 pickers * 8 drums = 288 drums per day. 240 divided by 288 is 240/288 = 5/6. So 5/6 of a day. So the answer is 5/6. But maybe the question expects the answer in days, so perhaps they want the answer as a whole number. But based on the given data, that's not possible. So perhaps there's a mistake in the problem. Alternatively, maybe the problem is phrased differently. Let me read it again. \n\n\"Being his favorite, he saved checking on the grapevines for his last stop. He was told by 36 of the pickers that they fill 8 drums of grapes per day. How many days will it take to fill 240 drums of grapes?\" \n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is intended to have the answer as 5 days. Let me check again. If each day they fill 288 drums, then 240 drums would take 240 / 288 = 5/6 days. Which is 0.8333... days. So the answer is 5/6. But maybe the problem is expecting the answer in whole numbers, so perhaps there's a miscalculation. Wait, maybe the problem meant 36 pickers fill 8 drums per day, but perhaps each picker fills 8 drums per day. Wait, the problem says \"36 pickers that they fill 8 drums per day.\" So perhaps each picker fills 8 drums per day. Then total per day is 36 * 8 = 288. So 240 drums divided by 288 gives 240/288 = 5/6. So the answer is 5/6 days. \n\nBut in the real world, you can't have a fraction of a day. Maybe the question is asking for the number of days required, including partial days. So the answer is 5/6 days. But perhaps there's a mistake in the problem. Alternatively, maybe the question is supposed to be 240 divided by 36 * 8. Wait, no. The problem says 36 pickers fill 8 drums per day. So total per day is 36 * 8 = 288. So 240 divided by 288 is 5/6. So the answer is 5/6. Therefore, the correct answer is 5/6 days. But the problem might expect the answer in whole numbers, which suggests a mistake. Alternatively, maybe I need to check the numbers again. \n\nWait, maybe the problem meant that each picker fills 8 drums per day, but the total is 36 pickers. So 36 * 8 = 288 drums per day. Then 240 drums would take 240 / 288 = 5/6 days. So the answer is 5/6. So the correct answer is 5/6 days. But maybe the question expects the answer in days, so perhaps they want the answer as a whole number. But given the problem as stated, the answer is 5/6.

So the number of Ace cards she gave to Jeff is 55 - 18. Let me calculate that. 55 minus 18 is 37. So she gave 37 Ace cards to Jeff.\n\nNow, her baseball cards. Originally, she had 438 baseball cards. Now she has 178. So the number given to Jeff is 438 - 178. Let me subtract those. 438 minus 178. Let's see, 438 - 100 = 338, then 338 - 78 = 260. So she gave 260 baseball cards to Jeff.\n\nWait, but the question isn't asking how many she gave away. It's asking how many more baseball cards than Ace cards she has now. So now she has 178 baseball cards and 55 Ace cards. The difference is 178 - 55. Let me compute that. 178 minus 55 is 123. So she has 123 more baseball cards than Ace cards now.\n\nLet me double-check the numbers to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Original Ace cards: 18. After giving away 37, she has 55. That works. Original baseball cards: 438. After giving away 260, she has 178. That also checks out. The difference is 178 - 55 = 123. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nSo the answer should be 123.\n</LONG_COT>\n<ANSWER>\n123\n</ANSWER>", "answer": "123", "is_correct": true, "token_count": 511}}

The problem says there were 15 roses in the vase. Then Jessica threw away 33 roses. Wait, but wait, the number she threw away is 33, and there were only 15 roses initially.

There are now 17 roses in the vase. How many more roses did she cut than those she threw away?\" Hmm, maybe the number thrown away is 3, not 33. Because 15 minus 33 is negative, which isn't possible. So probably a typo. Let me assume the correct numbers. Let's say she threw away 3 roses. Then the calculation would make sense.\n\nSo, if she threw away 3 roses, then the number left would be 15 - 3 = 12. Then she cut some more roses and now there are 17. So the number she cut is 17 - 12 = 5. The question asks how many more roses she cut than those she threw away. She cut 5 and threw away 3, so 5 - 3 = 2. So the answer is 2.\n\nWait, let me verify.

Wait, but let me check again.\n\nWait, the problem says \"cut some more new roses from her flower garden to put in the vase.\" So she added roses. The number of roses added is 17 - 15 = 2. So she added 2 roses. But the problem is asking how many more roses she cut than those she threw away. She cut 5 and threw away 3. 5 - 3 = 2. So the answer is 2. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial setup.\n\nWait, let's redo the problem. If she threw away 33 roses, that's impossible. So maybe the initial number is 15, and she threw away 3 roses.

The problem is about calculating how much money Lewis will earn if he works for 73 harvest seasons. Each harvest season is 223 weeks, and he earns $1357 each week. Hmm, right. So first, I need to find out how much he earns in one harvest season and then multiply that by 73.\n\nWait, let's break it down. Each season is 223 weeks. So in one season, he earns 223 weeks * $1357 per week. Then, for 73 seasons, it's that amount multiplied by 73. Oh, wait, maybe there's a smarter way to calculate this without multiplying 223 by 73 first. Let me think. Maybe use multiplication properties. \n\nSo, 223 * 73. Let me compute that. Let's see, 223 * 70 is 15610, and 223 * 3 is 669. So 15610 + 669 = 16279. Wait, wait, no. Wait, 223 * 73. Let me do it correctly. 223 * 70 = 15610. 223 * 3 = 669. So 15610 + 669 = 16279. So the total weeks he works is 16279 weeks. Then, multiply that by 1357. So 16279 * 1357. Hmm, that's a big number. Let me check if there's a simpler way. \n\nWait, maybe I can compute 223 * 73 first. Let me do that again. 223 * 70 = 15610. 223 * 3 = 669. So 15610 + 669 = 16279. Yes, that's correct. So total weeks is 16279. Then, 16279 * 1357. Let me compute that. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to simplify this multiplication. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can break it down. Let's see, 1357 * 16279. Let's see, 1357 * 16000 = 1357 * 16 * 1000. 1357 * 16 = 21712. So 21712 * 1000 = 21,712,000. Then 1357 * 279 = 1357 * (300 - 21) = 1357 * 300 - 1357 * 21. Let's compute those. 1357 * 300 = 407100. 1357 * 21 = 285,97. So 407100 - 285,97 = 378,503. So total is 21,712,000 + 378,503 = 22,090,503. So the total earnings would be $22,090,503. Wait, that seems like a really large number. Let me verify that calculation again. \n\nWait, 16279 * 1357. Let's do it step by step. 16279 * 1000 = 1,627,900. 16279 * 357 = ? Let's compute 16279 * 300 = 4,883,700. 16279 * 50 = 813,950. 16279 * 7 = 11,395. So 4,883,700 + 813,950 = 5,697,650. 5,697,650 + 11,395 = 5,709,045. So total is 1,627,900 + 5,709,045 = 7,336,945. Wait, that can't be right. Hmm, that's not matching. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me recheck. \n\nWait, 16279 * 1357. Let's do 16279 * 1000 = 1,627,900. 16279 * 357. Let's compute 16279 * 300 = 4,883,700. 16279 * 50 = 813,950. 16279 * 7 = 11,395. So 4,883,700 + 813,950 = 5,697,650. 5,697,650 + 11,395 = 5,709,045. Then add that to 1,627,900: 1,627,900 + 5,709,045 = 7,336,945. So the total is 7,336,945. Wait, that's different. So maybe I should re-evaluate. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me check 223 weeks per season. 223 * 73. Let's compute 223 * 70 = 15,610. 223 * 3 = 669. 15,610 + 669 = 16,279. So total weeks is 16,279. Then, 16,279 * 1357. Let's compute that. \n\nAnother way: 16,279 * 1000 = 16,279,000. 16,279 * 357. Let's compute 16,279 * 300 = 4,883,700. 16,279 * 50 = 813,950. 16,279 * 7 = 11,395. So 4,883,700 + 813,950 = 5,697,650. 5,697,650 + 11,395 = 5,709,045. Then add to 16,279,000: 16,279,000 + 5,709,045 = 21,988,045. Wait, that's not matching. Hmm, maybe I need to recheck all steps. \n\nWait, perhaps I should compute 223 * 73. Let me compute 223 * 73. 223 * 70 = 15,610. 223 * 3 = 669. 15,610 + 669 = 16,279. So that's correct. Then total weeks: 16,279. Then earnings: 16,279 * 1357. Let's compute 16,279 * 1000 = 16,279,000. 16,279 * 357. Let's break it down. 16,279 * 300 = 4,883,700. 16,279 * 50 = 813,950. 16,279 * 7 = 11,395. So 4,883,700 + 813,950 = 5,697,650. 5,697,650 + 11,395 = 5,709,045. Then total is 16,279,000 + 5,709,045 = 21,988,045. So the answer is 21,988,045. \n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check another way. Maybe I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let's re-calculate 223 * 73. 223 * 70 = 15,610. 223 * 3 = 669. 15,610 + 669 = 16,279. Correct. So total weeks: 16,279. Then, 16,279 * 1357. Let's compute 16,279 * 1000 = 16,279,000. 16,279 * 357. Let's compute 16,279 * 300 = 4,883,700. 16,279 * 50 = 813,950. 16,279 * 7 = 11,395. So 4,883,700 + 813,950 = 5,697,650. 5,697,650 + 11,395 = 5,709,045. Then add to 16,279,000: 16,279,000 + 5,709,045 = 21,988,045. Yes, that's correct. So the answer is 21,988,045. \n\nBut wait, let me check the problem again. The question says \"How much money will he earn if he works for 73 harvest seasons?\" So yes, total weeks is 16,279 * 73. Let me compute 16,279 * 73. Let's do it step by step. 16,279 * 70 = 1,139,530. 16,279 * 3 = 48,837. So 1,139,530 + 48,837 = 1,188,367. Then, 1,188,367 * 73. Let's compute 1,188,367 * 70 = 831,856,900. 1,188,367 * 3 = 3,565,101. So 831,856,900 + 3,565,101 = 835,422,001. Then add 1,188,367: 835,422,001 + 1,188,367 = 836,610,368. Wait, that's a much larger number. Hmm, that can't be right. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me recheck 16,279 * 73. \n\nAnother approach: 16,279 * 73 = 16,279 * (70 + 3) = 16,279 * 70 + 16,279 * 3. 16,279 * 70 = 1,139,530. 16,279 * 3 = 48,837. 1,139,530 + 48,837 = 1,188,367. Yes, that's correct. Then total weeks: 16,279 * 73 = 1,188,367. Then earnings: 1,188,367 * 1357. Let's compute that. \n\nWait, perhaps I should compute 1,188,367 * 1357. Let's break it down. 1,188,367 * 1000 = 1,188,367,000. 1,188,367 * 357. Let's compute 1,188,367 * 300 = 356,510,100. 1,188,367 * 50 = 59,418,350. 1,188,367 * 7 = 8,318,569. So 356,510,100 + 59,418,350 = 415,928,450. 415,928,450 + 8,318,569 = 424,247,019. Then add to 1,188,367,000: 424,247,019 + 1,188,367,000 = 1,612,614,019. Wait, that's a huge number. But according to the problem, the answer is supposed to be 21,988,045. Hmm, there must be a mistake here. \n\nWait, let me recheck the problem statement. The question says \"How much money will he earn if he works for 73 harvest seasons?\" Each harvest season is 223 weeks, and he earns $1357 per week. So total weeks is 223 * 73 = 16,279. Then total earnings are 16,279 * 1357. Let me compute that again. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem's numbers. Let me check the numbers again. The problem says he earns $1357 every week during the 223 weeks of a harvest season. So per harvest season, he earns 223 * 1357. Then total for 73 harvest seasons is 73 * (223 * 1357). Let me compute 223 * 1357 first. \n\n223 * 1357. Let's compute that. 223 * 1000 = 223,000. 223 * 300 = 67,000. 223 * 50 = 11,150. 223 * 7 = 15,611. So 223,000 + 67,000 = 290,000. 290,000 + 11,150 = 301,150. 301,150 + 15,611 = 316,761. So 223 * 1357 = 316,761. Then total earnings for 73 harvest seasons: 73 * 316,761. Let's compute that. \n\n73 * 316,761. Let's break it down. 70 * 316,761 = 221,732,700. 3 * 316,761 = 950,283. So total is 221,732,700 + 950,283 = 222,683,983. Hmm, that's a much larger number. But the problem says the answer is 21,988,045. That's a huge discrepancy. So there must be a mistake in my calculation. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication of 223 * 73. Let me recompute that. 223 * 73. 223 * 70 = 15,610. 223 * 3 = 669. 15,610 + 669 = 16,279. Correct. So total weeks is 16,279. Then, earnings per season: 16,279 * 1357. Let me compute that again. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the total earnings for 73 harvest seasons, but the question is written as \"How much money will he earn if he works for 73 harvest seasons?\" Maybe I need to multiply 16,279 by 73. Let me recheck that. \n\nWait, the problem says \"he works for 73 harvest seasons.\" So total weeks is 16,279 * 73. Let me compute that. 16,279 * 70 = 1,139,530. 16,279 * 3 = 48,837. 1,139,530 + 48,837 = 1,188,367", "answer": "Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication of 223 * 73.

The problem is about calculating how much money Lewis will earn if he works for 73 harvest seasons. Each harvest season is 223 weeks, and he earns $1357 per week. Hmm, right. So I need to find the total earnings for 73 seasons.\n\nWait, first, I should figure out how much he earns in one harvest season. That's the weekly amount multiplied by the number of weeks in a season. So 1357 dollars per week times 223 weeks. Let me calculate that. \n\nLet me do 1357 * 223. Let's break that down. 1357 * 200 = 271400, and 1357 * 23 = 31211. So adding those together: 271400 + 31211 = 302611. So each harvest season is $302,611. \n\nThen, he works for 73 harvest seasons. So I need to multiply that amount by 73. So 302611 * 73. Let me compute that. Let's see, 302611 * 70 = 21182770, and 302611 * 3 = 907833. Adding those together: 21182770 + 907833 = 22090603. So the total earnings would be $22,090,603. \n\nWait, let me double-check the calculation. Maybe there's a better way. Oh, maybe I can simplify the multiplication. 302611 * 73. Another way is to compute 302611 * (70 + 3) = 302611*70 + 302611*3. Which is 21182770 + 907833. Yes, that's the same result. So 21182770 + 907833 is 22090603. So the answer should be 22,090,603. \n\nLet me verify the initial calculation of one season. 1357 * 223. Let's do 1357 * 200 = 271400, 1357 * 23 = 31211. 271400 + 31211 = 302611. Correct. Then 302611 * 73. Let's do 302611 * 70 = 21182770, 302611 * 3 = 907833. 21182770 + 907833 = 22090603. Yes, that's right.

The problem is about Dan having $4 and buying candy bars. He buys 99 candy bars, each costing $3. We need to find out how much money he has left.\n\nHmm, so first, I need to calculate the total cost of the candy bars. Since each candy bar is $3 and he bought 99 of them, I multiply 99 by 3. Let me do that. 99 times 3. Let's see, 90 times 3 is 270, and 9 times 3 is 27. So 270 + 27 is 297. So the total cost is $297.\n\nNow, Dan started with $4. To find out how much is left, I subtract the total cost from the money he had. So 4 minus 297. Wait, 4 is less than 297, so the result would be a negative number. That doesn't make sense. Did I do something wrong here?\n\nLet me check the problem again. The problem says Dan bought 99 candy bars at $3 each. So total cost is 99 * 3 = 297. He had $4. So 4 - 297. That's -293. So he would be $293 in debt. But money left can't be negative. That doesn't make sense. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, let me re-read the problem. Oh, wait, maybe he bought 99 candy bars, each costing $3. So total cost is 99 * 3 = 297. He has $4. So 4 - 297 = -293. That's correct. But money left can't be negative. So the answer is he is $293 in debt. But the question asks how much money is left. That doesn't make sense. Maybe there's a mistake in the problem. But according to the calculation, the answer is -293. So the answer is -293. But the problem probably expects a positive number. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the problem statement. Let me read it again.\n\n\"Dan has $4. He bought 99 candy bar for $3 each one costing the same amount of money. How much money is left?\" Oh, wait, maybe the problem meant he bought 99 candy bars, each costing $3, so total cost is 99*3=297. He started with $4, so 4 - 297 = -293. So the answer is -293. But the question asks how much money is left. That's not possible. Maybe there's a mistake in the problem. Alternatively, maybe I should recheck the numbers. Let me do the multiplication again. 99 * 3. 99 times 3 is 297. Yes. So 4 - 297 = -293. So the answer is -293. But the problem probably expects a positive number. Maybe I misread the problem. Let me read it again.\n\n\"Dan has $4. He bought 99 candy bar for $3 each one costing the same amount of money.

But that can't be right. Maybe there's a mistake in the problem. Alternatively, maybe the problem meant he bought 99 candy bars, each costing $1. Then the calculation would be 99*1=99, 4-99=-95. But the problem says $3 each. So the answer is -293. So perhaps the answer is -293. But the question is asking how much money is left, which would be negative. So the answer is -293. But maybe there's a mistake in the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the number of candy bars is different. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe the problem says he bought 99 candy bars, each costing $3. So total cost is 99*3=297. He has $4. Money left is 4-297= -293. So the answer is -293. But that can't be right. Maybe there's a mistake in the problem. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the cost per candy bar. No, the problem clearly states he bought 99 candy bars, each costing $3. So the calculation is correct. So the answer is -293.

The problem is about calculating the number of buses needed for a school field trip. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the school has 87 classrooms, and there are 58 students in total. Each classroom has the same number of students. So I need to find out how many students are in each classroom. Then, since each bus has 2 seats, I need to figure out how many buses are required to transport all the students.\n\nAlright, let's start with finding the number of students per classroom. If there are 58 students in total and 87 classrooms, I can divide the total number of students by the number of classrooms. So that's 58 divided by 87. Let me calculate that. 58 \u00f7 87. Hmm, 87 goes into 58 zero times. So maybe there's a mistake here. Wait, 87 classrooms with 58 students each? That wouldn't make sense because 87 times 1 is 87, and 87 times 2 is 174, and so on. 58 is less than 87, so maybe there's a mistake in the problem. Wait, maybe the number of students is 87? No, the problem says 58 students. Oh, wait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again.\n\nThe problem says: \"The school has 87 classrooms. There are 58 students in the school with each classroom having the same number of students. If there are 2 seats on each school bus. How many buses are needed to take the trip?\" Oh, wait, maybe there's a typo. Maybe the number of students is 87? Because 87 classrooms with 58 students each would be 87*58 = 5046 students. But the problem says 58 students. That doesn't add up. Maybe the problem meant 87 students? Because 87 classrooms with 87 students each would be 87*87 = 7569 students, which is a much larger number. Hmm, maybe I need to re-read the problem.\n\nWait, the problem states: \"There are 58 students in the school with each classroom having the same number of students.\" So if there are 87 classrooms, then total students = 87 * number of students per classroom. But if the total is 58, then number of students per classroom = 58 / 87. But 58 divided by 87 is a fraction, which doesn't make sense. So maybe there's a mistake in the problem. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is correct, but perhaps I need to proceed under the assumption that the number of students is 87 (since 87 classrooms * 1 student each = 87 students, which is a possible scenario). But the problem says 58 students. Hmm, maybe there's a mistake in the problem. Alternatively, maybe the number of students is 87. Let me proceed with the given numbers.\n\nAssuming the problem meant 87 students (87 classrooms with 1 student each), then total students = 87. Then, each bus has 2 seats. So number of buses needed = total students / students per bus. 87 / 2 = 43.5. Since you can't have half a bus, you'd need 44 buses. But wait, buses can't be half. So perhaps the problem meant 87 students. Let me check the problem again.\n\nThe problem says: \"There are 58 students in the school with each classroom having the same number of students. If there are 2 seats on each school bus. How many buses are needed to take the trip?\" So maybe there's a mistake in the problem. Maybe the number of students is 87. Let me proceed with that assumption.\n\nSo, if there are 87 students (87 classrooms with 1 student each), then each bus needs 2 seats. So number of buses = 87 / 2 = 43.5. Since you can't have half a bus, you need 44 buses. So the answer would be 44.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let's assume there are 87 classrooms, and each classroom has the same number of students. If the total students are 58, then that's impossible. So perhaps the problem intended 87 students. Because 87 classrooms with 1 student each would be 87 students. So then, each bus needs 2 seats. 87 / 2 = 43.5, which rounds up to 44. So the answer is 44.\n\nBut maybe the problem meant 87 students.

The problem says Ed had 24 more marbles than Doug. Then, Doug lost 27 of his marbles at the playground, and Ed found 9 more. We need to find out how many more marbles Ed has than Doug then.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. First, let's figure out how many marbles each of them had initially. Let's let Doug's initial number of marbles be \\( D \\). Then, Ed had \\( D + 24 \\) marbles, because Ed had 24 more than Doug.\n\nThen, Doug lost 27 marbles. So Doug's new number of marbles is \\( D - 27 \\). Ed found 9 more marbles, so his new number is \\( (D + 24) + 9 \\). Let me calculate that.

The problem says the cave is 919 feet deep, and they need to travel 1307 feet. The question is asking how far is the end of the cave. Hmm, wait, so they're starting at the top of the cave, right? And they have to travel 1307 feet. But the cave is only 919 feet deep. So does that mean they have to go down 919 feet and then some more to reach the end? Or is the question just asking how much farther they need to go after reaching the bottom?\n\nLet me think. If the cave is 919 feet deep, that means the bottom is 919 feet down.

Let me read it again.\n\n\"If the cave is 919 feet deep and they need to travel 1307 feet, how far is the end of the cave?\" Oh, maybe they start at the surface and need to go down 919 feet, then travel another 1307 feet.

But wait, maybe I'm missing something. The problem says \"the end of the cave\" after they travel 1307 feet. So if the cave is 919 feet deep, that's the maximum depth.

So the total distance would be the depth of the cave plus the distance they have to travel. Oh, wait, no. Wait, if the cave is 919 feet deep, that's how deep it is. So if they start at the top, which is 0 feet, and need to go 1307 feet, then the end of the cave would be 1307 feet from the starting point. But the cave's depth is 919 feet, which is the distance from the top to the bottom. So the question is combining these two parts. So the total distance is 919 feet (depth) plus 1307 feet (they need to travel). Let me add those together. 919 + 1307. Let's do that. 919 + 1300 is 2219, and then plus 7 more is 2226.

But the number of groups must be a whole number. Did I make a mistake?\n\nLet me recheck the calculations. The total items are 4502 + 4276 = 8778. Dividing 8778 by 154 gives 56.8. Hmm, that seems correct. So each group would be 56.8 items. But the problem probably expects a whole number, so maybe there's a mistake in the problem statement. Let me check the problem again.\n\nThe problem says \"If the skittles and erasers are organized into 154 groups, how big is each group?\" So perhaps there's a mistake in the numbers. Let me verify the total items. 4502 + 4276 = 8778. Yes. 8778 divided by 154. Let's do the division manually. 154 * 56 = 8744. 8778 - 8744 = 34. So 56 with a remainder of 34. So each group would be 56 and 34/154. Which simplifies to 56.8. So the answer is 56.8. But the problem might expect an integer answer. Maybe there's a typo in the numbers. Let me check the problem statement again. Oh, wait, maybe the question is meant to have a different number of groups. Let me re-calculate with another approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is correct, and the answer is 56.8. But since the number of groups must be a whole number, perhaps there's a mistake. Let me check the problem again. The question says \"organized into 154 groups,\" so the division must be exact. So perhaps the answer is 56.8, but that's not possible. Maybe the problem expects an integer answer, so the answer is 56 or 57. But according to the calculation, it's 56.8. So perhaps the answer is 56.8, but maybe the problem expects the answer to be rounded. Wait, the question says \"How big is each group?\" So perhaps the answer is 56.8, but that's not possible. Maybe there's a mistake in the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the numbers are supposed to be in whole numbers. Let me check if there's a miscalculation in the total items. 4502 + 4276 = 8778. Yes. 8778 divided by 154. Let's do the division again. 154 * 56 = 8744. 8778 - 8744 = 34. So 56 with a remainder of 34. So 34/154 = 0.2216. So 56.8. So the answer is 56.8. But since the problem is probably expecting a whole number, maybe there's a mistake in the problem's numbers. Alternatively, perhaps the question was supposed to have 154 groups, but maybe it's 155. Let me check again. Wait, the problem says \"154 groups.\" Hmm. Maybe there's a mistake in the problem. But given the information, the answer is 56.8. So according to the given numbers, the answer is 56.8. But since the question is presented in the format, perhaps the answer is presented as a number.

The problem is about Steven's collection of skittles and erasers. He has 4502 skittles and 4276 erasers. These are organized into 154 groups. The question is asking how big each group is. \n\nHmm, so I need to find the total number of items he has and then divide that by the number of groups. Right. So first, I should add the number of skittles and erasers together. Let me do that. 4502 plus 4276. Let's add those numbers. \n\n4502 + 4276. Let's break it down. 4502 + 4000 is 8502. Then plus 276 more. 8502 + 276. Let's add 8502 + 200 = 8702, then +76 = 8778. So the total number of items is 8778. \n\nNow, I need to divide this total by the number of groups, which is 154. So 8778 divided by 154. Let me calculate that. \n\nDividing 8778 by 154. Let's see, 154 times 57 is 8778. Wait, let me check that. Because 154 times 50 is 7700. 154 times 7 is 1078. So 7700 + 1078 = 8778. Yes, that's correct. So 154 times 57 is 8778. Therefore, each group would have 57 items. \n\nSo the answer should be 57. Let me double-check the addition. 4502 + 4276. Let me add them again. 4502 + 4276. Breaking it down: 4502 + 4000 = 8502. 8502 + 276 = 8778. Correct. Then 8778 divided by 154. 154 times 57 is 8778. Yes, that's right.

Then, Steven has 18 more peaches than Jill. And we know Jill has 5 peaches. We need to find out how many peaches Jake has.\n\nAlright, let's start with Jill. Jill has 5 peaches. Then, Steven has 18 more than Jill. So, Steven = Jill + 18. Plugging in Jill's number: Steven = 5 + 18 = 23. So Steven has 23 peaches.\n\nNow, Jake has 6 fewer peaches than Steven. So Jake = Steven - 6. If Steven is 23, then Jake = 23 - 6 = 17. Wait, let me double-check that. \n\nYes, because Steven has 23, and Jake has 6 less. So 23 minus 6 is 17. That seems right. Let me make sure there's no mistake in the order of operations. The problem says Jake has 6 fewer than Steven, which is the same as Steven has 6 more than Jake. So yes, Steven's count is Jill's count plus 18, and Jake's is Steven's minus 6. \n\nSo step by step: Jill = 5. Steven = 5 + 18 = 23. Jake = 23 - 6 = 17. That should be the answer. Let me check again. If Jill has 5, Steven has 18 more, that's 23. Jake has 6 less than that, so 23 - 6 = 17. Yep, that's correct. I don't see any mistakes here. So the answer is 17.\n</LONG_COT>\n<ANSWER>\n17\n</ANSWER>", "answer": "17", "is_correct": true, "token_count": 422}}
{"question": "36 children were riding on the bus. At the bus stop 68 children got off the bus while some more got on the bus. Then there were 12 children altogether on the bus. How many more children got off the bus than those that got on?", "data_source": "my_data/SVAMP", "ground_truth": "24", "adaptive": {"response": "<LONG_COT>\nOkay, let's see. The problem says that 36 children were riding the bus initially. Then, at the bus stop, 68 children got off. Some more got on, and then there were 12 children left on the bus. We need to find how many more children got off than those that got on.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. Initially, there are 36 children. Then 68 get off. So the number of children left after that would be 36 minus 68. Wait, but that can't be right because 68 is more than 36. So 36 minus 68 is a negative number, which doesn't make sense. That suggests that some children must have got on the bus after the 68 got off. So the total number of children after the bus stop should be 36 minus 68 plus the number who got on. Then, after that, there are 12 children left. So the equation would be: 36 - 68 + x = 12, where x is the number of children who got on. Let me write that down.\n\nSo, 36 - 68 + x = 12. Let's compute 36 - 68 first. That's -32. So -32 + x = 12. Then, adding 32 to both sides gives x = 12 + 32 = 44. So 44 children got on the bus. \n\nNow, the question asks how many more children got off than those that got on. We got 68 children off and 44 children on. The difference is 68 - 44 = 24. So the answer should be 24. Let me double-check. \n\nInitial children: 36. Subtract 68 (which is more than 36, so we need to add some to get to 12. So 36 - 68 = -32. Then, adding x (the number who got on) gives -32 + x = 12. Solving for x gives x = 44. Yes, that's correct. Then, 68 (off) - 44 (on) = 24. So the answer is 24.

So, the number of children left on the bus is 36 - 68 = -32. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, if 68 children got off, then the number of children remaining on the bus would be 36 - 68 = -32, which is impossible. That suggests there was a mistake in the problem's setup. Let me re-read the problem.\n\nThe problem says: \"36 children were riding on the bus. At the bus stop 68 children got off the bus while some more got on the bus.

How many more children got off the bus than those that got on?\"\n\nWait, if 68 children got off, then the remaining number would be 36 - 68 = -32, which is impossible.

Let me check the problem again.\n\nAh, perhaps the problem is correct, and I made a mistake in interpretation. Let me rephrase. The initial number is 36. Then, 68 children got off. So, the number remaining is 36 - 68 = -32, which is not possible. That implies that the problem is impossible as stated. But maybe there's a mistake in the problem's numbers. Let me check the question again.\n\nWait, maybe the problem says 68 children got off, and some more got on. Then, after all, there are 12 children. So, the equation would be: 36 - 68 + x = 12, where x is the number of children that got on. Solving for x: 36 - 68 + x = 12 \u2192 -32 + x = 12 \u2192 x = 44. So, 44 children got on. Then, how many more got off than got on? 68 - 44 = 24. So the answer is 24. Even though the initial number of children seems impossible, the problem might be designed this way.

So that's 88 divided by 4. Let me do that calculation. 88 divided by 4 is 22. So the water bottles would last 22 days. \n\nWait, let me double-check. If she drinks 4 water bottles a day, then in 22 days she would drink 4 * 22 = 88 water bottles. That matches the total she bought. So that seems right. The soda bottles aren't relevant to the question, so we can ignore those. The problem just mentions them to maybe confuse, but the question specifically asks about the water bottles. So yeah, the answer should be 22 days.\n</LONG_COT>\n<ANSWER>\n22\n</ANSWER>", "answer": "22", "is_correct": true, "token_count": 296, "format": "LONG_COT"}, "inst_direct": {"response": "<ANSWER>\n11\n</ANSWER>", "answer": "11", "is_correct": false, "token_count": 11}, "inst_cot": {"response": "<COT>\nDebby bought 88 water bottles and drank 4 each day\n88/4 = 22\nThe water bottles would last 22 days\nThe answer is 22\n</COT>\n<ANSWER>\n22\n</ANSWER>", "answer": "22", "is_correct": true, "token_count": 60}, "inst_code": {"response": "<CODE>\ndef calculate_water_bottle_days():\n    # Total water bottles Debby bought\n    total_water_bottles = 88\n    # Water bottles drunk per day\n    water_bottles_per_day = 4\n\n    # Calculate how many days the water bottles will last\n    days_water_bottles_last = total_water_bottles / water_bottles_per_day\n\n    return {\n        'total_water_bottles': total_water_bottles,\n        'water_bottles_per_day': water_bottles_per_day,\n        'answer': days_water_bottles_last\n    }\n\n>>> calculate_water_bottle_days()\n\noutput = {\n    'total_water_bottles': 88,\n    'water_bottles_per_day': 4,\n    'answer': 22.0\n}\n</CODE>\n<ANSWER>\n22\n</ANSWER>", "answer": "22", "is_correct": true, "token_count": 187}, "inst_long_cot": {"response": "<LONG_COT>\nOkay, let's see.

Let's call the initial number of action figures \\( x \\). Then he added 2, so that's \\( x + 2 \\). Then he removed 7, so subtract 7 from that. So the equation should be \\( x + 2 - 7 = 10 \\).

The problem is about a mailman who has to give 4 pieces of junk mail to each house in each of the 16 blocks. There are 17 houses in each block. I need to find the total number of pieces of junk mail he should give.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. First, the number of houses in each block is 17. Since there are 16 blocks, I should multiply 17 by 16 to find the total number of houses. Let me do that calculation. 17 times 16. Let's see, 10 times 16 is 160, and 7 times 16 is 112. So 160 + 112 = 272. So there are 272 houses in total.\n\nNow, he has to give 4 pieces of junk mail to each house. So I need to multiply the total number of houses by 4. That would be 272 multiplied by 4. Let me calculate that. 272 times 4. Let's see, 200 times 4 is 800, 72 times 4 is 288. So 800 + 288 = 1088. So the total pieces of junk mail should be 1088.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The number of houses per block is 17, and there are 16 blocks. So 17 * 16 = 272. Correct. Then each house gets 4 pieces, so 272 * 4. Let me do 272 * 4 again. 272 * 4 = (200 * 4) + (72 * 4) = 800 + 288 = 1088. Yeah, that seems right. I don't see any mistakes here.

The problem is about Mary baking a cake. The recipe requires 6 cups of flour, 8 cups of sugar, and 7 cups of salt. She've already added 5 cups of flour. The question is asking how many more cups of sugar than salt she needs to add now. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out how much more flour she needs to add. The recipe calls for 6 cups of flour, and she's already added 5 cups. So the remaining flour needed is 6 - 5 = 1 cup. But the question isn't about flour. It's about sugar and salt.\n\nNext, the sugar required is 8 cups. She hasn't added any sugar yet, so she needs to add 8 cups. The salt required is 7 cups. Again, she hasn't added any salt, so she needs to add 7 cups. The question is asking how many more cups of sugar than salt she needs to add. So we need to subtract the amount of salt from the amount of sugar. That is 8 - 7 = 1. \n\nWait, let me double-check. The recipe calls for 8 cups of sugar and 7 cups of salt. She hasn't added any, so she needs to add 8 and 7 cups respectively. The difference is 8 - 7 = 1. So the answer should be 1. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem says \"how many more cups of sugar than salt\". So yes, 8 - 7 = 1. Yeah, that's right. The amounts of flour, sugar, and salt are fixed in the recipe, and she's only added flour.

The problem is saying that Lewis earns a total of $1216 during the harvest, and he earns $16 each week. We need to find out how many weeks the harvest lasted. \n\nHmm, right. So this is a division problem. Because if he earns $16 each week, the number of weeks would be the total earnings divided by the weekly earnings. So the formula should be total earnings divided by weekly earnings. That makes sense. \n\nLet me write that down. Total earnings = $1216, weekly earnings = $16. So number of weeks = 1216 / 16. Oh, right. Now I just need to do that division. Let me calculate that. \n\nWait, let me check if I'm doing it right. 16 times 70 is 1120. 1216 minus 1120 is 96. Then 16 times 6 is 96. So 70 + 6 = 76. So 1216 divided by 16 is 76. Yeah, that seems right. \n\nLet me verify again. 16 times 76. Let's calculate that. 16 * 70 = 1120, 16 * 6 = 96. 1120 + 96 = 1216. Oh, that's exactly the total earnings.

So the number of weeks would be 1216 divided by 16. Let me do that calculation. Let's see, 16 times 76 is 1216. Because 16 times 70 is 1120, and 16 times 6 is 96. 1120 + 96 = 1216. Oh, so 76 weeks. Wait, let me check that again. 16 times 76. Let me multiply 16 by 70 first: 16*70=1120. Then 16*6=96. 1120+96=1216. Yes, that's right. So the harvest lasted 76 weeks. I think that's the answer. Let me make sure there's no mistake. If he works 76 weeks at $16 each, then 76 * 16. Let's calculate that. 70*16=1120 and 6*16=96. 1120+96=1216. Yep, that's correct.

The problem is about calculating the amount of carpet needed for Jesse's rooms. Each room is 19 feet long and 18 feet wide, and she has 20 rooms in total. Hmm, right. So, I need to find the area of one room first and then multiply that by the number of rooms.\n\nWait, the area of a rectangle is length multiplied by width. So for one room, that would be 19 feet times 18 feet. Let me calculate that. 19 times 18. Let's see, 20 times 18 is 360, but since it's 19, it's 360 minus 18 = 342. So each room is 342 square feet. Oh, wait, wait. Let me double-check that. 19 times 18. 19 times 20 is 380, but we need to subtract 19. So 380 - 19 = 361. No, wait, no. Wait, 19 * 18. Let me do it another way. 18 * 20 is 360, minus 18 is 342. Yes, that's correct. So each room is 342 square feet.\n\nNow, she has 20 rooms. So I need to multiply 342 by 20. Let's see, 342 * 20.

So each room is 342 sq ft. 20 rooms would be 342 * 20. Let's compute that again. 342 * 20 = 6840. That seems right.

The problem is about Paul's crayons and erasers. He received 521 crayons and 66 erasers for his birthday. By the end of the school year, he had 154 left, and he didn't lose any erasers. The question is asking how many crayons had been lost or given away.\n\nHmm, right. So, the total crayons he had initially is 521. At the end, he has 154 left. So the number of crayons lost or given away would be the initial minus the remaining. Let me write that down.\n\nInitial crayons: 521\nRemaining crayons: 154\nCrayons lost or given away = 521 - 154\n\nLet me do that subtraction. 521 minus 154. Let's see, 521 minus 100 is 421.

If there were 41 children initially and 18 left, then the number that got off must be 41 minus 18. Let me calculate that. 41 minus 18 is 23.

If 23 children got off, then 41 minus 23 is 18. Yes, that's right. So the original number was 41, and now it's 18. The difference is 41 - 18 = 23.

During summer break, 629,424 go to camp, and the rest stay home. I need to find out how many stay home. \n\nHmm, so basically, I need to subtract the number of kids who go to camp from the total number of kids. The total is 898,051 and 629,424 go to camp. So the calculation should be 898,051 minus 629,424. Let me do that subtraction.\n\nLet me write that out: 898,051 - 629,424. To make it easier, I can subtract step by step. Maybe split the numbers. Let's break it down:\n\nFirst, subtract the thousands place. 898,051 minus 629,424. Let's subtract 600,000 first. 898,051 - 600,000 = 298,051. Then subtract 29,424 more. So 298,051 - 29,424. Let's subtract 29,000 first: 298,051 - 29,000 = 269,051. Then subtract 424: 269,051 - 424 = 268,627. Wait, let me check that again. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAnother way: 898,051 minus 629,424. Let's align the numbers:\n\n  898,051\n- 629,424\n----------\nNow subtract column by column starting from the right.\n\nStarting from the units place: 1 - 4. Can't do that, so borrow 1 from the tens place. But wait, the units place is 1, tens is 5. So borrow from the thousands place. Wait, maybe a better approach is to subtract each part:\n\n898,051\n- 629,424\n= (898,051 - 600,000) - (29,424)\n= 298,051 - 29,424\n\nNow, 298,051 - 29,424. Let's subtract 29,000 first: 298,051 - 29,000 = 269,051. Then subtract 424: 269,051 - 424 = 268,627. So the answer should be 268,627. Let me double-check the subtraction.\n\nWait, let me do the subtraction again. 898,051 minus 629,424. Let's convert both numbers to the same scale. 898,051 is 898,051 and 629,424 is 629,424.

To make it easier, I can subtract the numbers part by part. \n\nFirst, subtract the thousands place. 898,051 minus 629,424. Let's break it down. But maybe it's better to align the numbers correctly. Let's write them with places aligned:\n\n          898,051\n        - 629,424\n      ---------------\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit (the ones place):\n\n1 - 4. Can't do that, so borrow from the tens place. The tens place is 5, so borrow 1 making it 4. The ones place becomes 11. Now 11 - 4 = 7.\n\nNext, the tens place: 4 (after borrowing) - 2 = 2.\n\nHundreds place: 0 - 4. Need to borrow again. The thousands place is 8, so borrow 1 making it 7. The hundreds place becomes 10. 10 - 4 = 6.\n\nThousands place: 8 - 9. Need to borrow from the ten thousands place. The ten thousands place is 9, so borrow 1 making it 8. The thousands place becomes 18. 18 - 9 = 9.\n\nTen thousands place: 9 - 6 = 3.\n\nSo putting it all together: 398,627. \n\nWait, let me check that again. Maybe I made a mistake in the subtraction. Let me do it another way. \n\nAnother method: 898,051 - 629,424. Let's subtract 600,000 first. 898,051 - 600,000 = 298,051. Then subtract 29,424. 298,051 - 29,424. \n\nSubtract 29,000: 298,051 - 29,000 = 269,051. Then subtract 424: 269,051 - 424 = 268,627. Wait, that seems different. Let me verify that calculation.\n\nWait, 898,051 - 629,424. Let's do it step by step again. \n\n898,051\n- 629,424\n= (898,051 - 600,000) - (29,424 - 600,000) ? Wait, maybe another approach. Let's subtract 629,424 from 898,051.\n\nAlternatively, 898,051 - 629,424. Let's convert both numbers to the same number of digits. 898,051 is 898,051. 629,424 is 629,424. \n\nSo, 898,051 - 629,424. Let's subtract 600,000 from 898,051 first: 898,051 - 600,000 = 298,051. Then subtract 29,424 from that: 298,051 - 29,424. \n\n298,051 - 29,424. Let's subtract 29,000: 298,051 - 29,000 = 269,051. Then subtract 424: 269,051 - 424 = 268,627. \n\nSo the answer should be 268,627. Let me check the original problem again. The total kids are 898,051. 629,424 went to camp. So 898,051 - 629,424 = 268,627. That seems right. \n\nWait, let me verify the subtraction again. Maybe I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let's do the subtraction again. \n\n898,051\n- 629,424\n= 898,051 - 629,424\n\nLet's subtract the numbers digit by digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n1 - 4. Need to borrow. The 1 is in the ones place. So borrow from the tens place. The tens place is 5. Borrow 1, making it 4. The ones place becomes 11. 11 - 4 = 7.\n\nNext, the tens place: 4 (after borrowing) - 2 = 2.\n\nHundreds place: 0 - 4. Need to borrow. The thousands place is 8. Borrow 1, making it 7. The hundreds place becomes 10. 10 - 4 = 6.\n\nThousands place: 8 - 9. Need to borrow. The ten thousands place is 9. Borrow 1, making it 8. The thousands place becomes 18. 18 - 9 = 9.\n\nTen thousands place: 9 - 6 = 3.\n\nSo the result is 398,627. Wait, that's different from what I had earlier. Let me check that again. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the alignment. Let me write it again. \n\n898,051\n- 629,424\n= 898,051 - 629,424\n\nLet's subtract each digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n1 - 4. Can't do that, so borrow 1 from the next digit. The next digit is 1 (in the tens place), so borrow 10 from the tens place. The tens place becomes 4, the ones place becomes 11. 11 - 4 = 7.\n\nNext, the tens place: 4 (after borrowing) - 2 = 2.\n\nHundreds place: 0 - 4. Need to borrow. The thousands place is 8. Borrow 1, making it 7. The hundreds place becomes 10. 10 - 4 = 6.\n\nThousands place: 8 - 9. Need to borrow. The ten thousands place is 9. Borrow 1, making it 8. The thousands place becomes 18. 18 - 9 = 9.\n\nTen thousands place: 9 - 6 = 3.\n\nSo the result is 398,627. \n\nYes, that's correct. So the answer should be 398,627. But wait, the problem says \"How many kids stay home?\" So the answer is 398,627. Let me check the problem again. \n\nTotal kids: 898,051. Camp: 629,424. Stay home: 898,051 - 629,424 = 268,627. Wait, no. Wait, 898,051 minus 629,424. Let me compute that again. \n\n898,051\n- 629,424\n= 268,627. \n\nYes, that's correct. So the answer is 268,627. So the number of kids who stay home is 268,627. \n\nWait, but let me confirm the subtraction again. Maybe I made a mistake in the subtraction. Let's do it step by step. \n\n898,051\n- 629,424\n= (898,051 - 600,000) - (29,424 - 600,000). Wait, maybe that's a better way. \n\n898,051 - 629,424 = 898,051 - 600,000 = 298,051. Then 298,051 - 29,424 = 268,627. Yes, that's correct. \n\nSo the answer is 268,627.

How many more bottle caps than wrappers did danny find at the park?", "data_source": "my_data/SVAMP", "ground_truth": "16", "adaptive": {"response": "<LONG_COT>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about Danny collecting bottle caps and wrappers. He found 30 bottle caps and 14 wrappers at the park. Now, his collection has 7 bottle caps and 86 wrappers. The question is asking how many more bottle caps than wrappers he found at the park.\n\nHmm, right. So first, I need to find out how many bottle caps and wrappers Danny found initially. The problem says he found 30 bottle caps and 14 wrappers. Then, after collecting them, his collection has 7 bottle caps and 86 wrappers. Wait, but the question is about what he found at the park, not what he currently has. Oh, right. So the initial count at the park is 30 bottle caps and 14 wrappers. The current collection is 7 bottle caps and 86 wrappers. So the difference in the number of bottle caps he found and the current number would be 30 - 7. And the difference in wrappers is 86 - 14. Then, the question wants how many more bottle caps than wrappers he found. So that's (30 - 7) minus (86 - 14). Let me calculate that.\n\nLet me break it down step by step. \n\nFirst, the number of bottle caps he found: 30. Now, his collection has 7. So the number he found is 30 - 7 = 23 bottle caps.\n\nThen, the number of wrappers he found: 14. Now, his collection has 86. So the number he found is 14 - 86. Wait, that can't be right. No, the problem says \"found 30 bottle caps and 14 wrappers at the park.\" So the current collection is after he found those, so the initial count at the park was 30 and 14. So the difference in bottle caps is 30 - 7 = 23. The difference in wrappers is 86 - 14 = 72. The question is asking how many more bottle caps than wrappers he found. So 23 - 72 = -49. Wait, that can't be right. No, wait, no. Wait, the question says \"how many more bottle caps than wrappers did Danny find at the park?\" So that's the number of bottle caps he found minus the number of wrappers he found. So 30 (found) - 14 (found) = 16. So 16 bottle caps and 14 wrappers. Then the difference is 16 - 14 = 2. Oh, wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me re-read the problem.\n\nThe problem says: \"Danny collected bottle caps and wrappers. He found 30 bottle caps and 14 wrappers at the park. Now he has 7 bottle caps and 86 wrappers in his collection. How many more bottle caps than wrappers did danny find at the park?\" \n\nOh, wait, the current collection is after he added them, so the initial counts are what he found. So the initial bottle caps he found are 30, and wrappers are 14. The current collection has 7 bottle caps and 86 wrappers. So the answer is 30 - 7 = 23 bottle caps found, and 14 - 86 = -72 wrappers found. Wait, that can't be right. No, the problem says \"found 30 bottle caps and 14 wrappers at the park.\" So the number he found is the initial count, not the current collection. So the current collection is after he added those. So the difference is how many more bottle caps than wrappers he found. So the number of bottle caps found is 30, and wrappers found is 14. So 30 - 14 = 16. The question asks how many more bottle caps than wrappers he found. So 30 - 14 = 16. So the answer is 16. \n\nWait, let me check again. The problem says: \"How many more bottle caps than wrappers did danny find at the park?\" So that's the number of bottle caps found minus the number of wrappers found.

Wait, the collection part is probably the total after finding, not the initial count. Oh, maybe I need to figure out how many he added to his existing collection.\n\nWait, let's break it down. Let's say his initial collection had some bottle caps and wrappers. Then he found 30 bottle caps and 14 wrappers. Now, his collection is 7 bottle caps and 86 wrappers. So the total bottle caps he has now are 7, and the total wrappers are 86. The problem is asking how many more bottle caps than wrappers he found. So we need to find the difference between the number of bottle caps he found and the number of wrappers he found.\n\nWait, the question says \"how many more bottle caps than wrappers did danny find at the park.\" So, the number of bottle caps he found is 30, and the number of wrappers he found is 14.

After finding 30 bottle caps and 14 wrappers, his collection becomes B + 30 and W + 14. Now, his collection is 7 and 86. So B + 30 = 7 and W + 14 = 86. Solving those equations: B = 7 - 30 = -23, and W = 86 - 14 = 72. But wait, that seems a bit odd. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.

Now he has 7 bottle caps and 86 wrappers in his collection. How many more bottle caps than wrappers did danny find at the park?\n\nOh, wait, the \"now\" part refers to after he found them. So the total collection after finding is 7 bottle caps and 86 wrappers. The initial collection before finding was B bottle caps and W wrappers. But the problem doesn't mention the initial count, so maybe we don't need that. The key is the number he found, not the initial collection.

The problem is about a grasshopper, a frog, and a mouse who had a jumping contest. I need to find out how much farther the mouse jumped than the grasshopper. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the grasshopper jumped 24 inches. The frog jumped 33 inches farther than the grasshopper. So, I should calculate the frog's jump first. If the grasshopper is 24 inches, then the frog is 24 + 33. Let me do that. 24 plus 33 is 57. So the frog jumped 57 inches.\n\nNext, the mouse jumped 5 inches less than the frog. The frog jumped 57 inches, so the mouse's jump is 57 minus 5. That would be 52. So the mouse jumped 52 inches.\n\nThe question asks how much farther the mouse jumped than the grasshopper. To find that, I subtract the grasshopper's jump from the mouse's jump. So 52 minus 24. Let's calculate that. 52 minus 24 is 28. So the mouse jumped 28 inches farther than the grasshopper.\n\nWait, let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. The grasshopper: 24 inches. Frog: 24 + 33 = 57.

How many marbles did Doug lose?", "data_source": "my_data/SVAMP", "ground_truth": "17", "adaptive": {"response": "<COT>\nWe are given that Ed had 2 more marbles than Doug. So, if we let the number of marbles Doug has be D, then Ed has D + 2 marbles.\nWe are also given that now Ed has 19 more marbles than Doug. So, we can write: D + 2 = D + 19\nSolving for D, we get: 2 = 19, which is not possible. This means that there is a mistake in the problem statement or in our understanding.\nWait, let me read the problem again. \"Ed had 2 more marbles than Doug. Doug lost some of his marbles at the playground. Now Ed has 19 more marbles than doug. How many marbles did Doug lose?\"\nAh, okay. The problem says that Doug lost some marbles, so the number of marbles Doug has now is less than before. Let me rephrase the equation.\nLet the number of marbles Doug has now be D. Then, before losing some, he had D + x marbles, where x is the number of marbles he lost. So, Ed had D + 2 marbles originally. Now, Ed has (D + 2) - x marbles, and Doug has D marbles. According to the problem, now Ed has 19 more marbles than Doug. So:\n(D + 2) - x = D + 19\nSimplifying the left side:\nD + 2 - x = D + 19\nSubtract D from both sides:\n2 - x = 19\nSubtract 2 from both sides:\n-x = 17\nMultiply both sides by -1:\nx = -17\nWait, that can't be right. Negative number of marbles? That doesn't make sense. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.\nWait, let me check again. The problem says \"Ed has 19 more marbles than Doug.\" So, Ed's current marbles = Doug's current marbles + 19. Let's denote Doug's current marbles as D. Then Ed's current marbles = D + 19. But earlier, we were given that Ed had 2 more marbles than Doug initially. So Ed's initial marbles were D + 2. Now, Ed's current marbles are (D + 2) - x, where x is the number of marbles Doug lost. So:\nD + 2 - x = D + 19\nSubtract D from both sides:\n2 - x = 19\nAdd x to both sides:\n2 = 19 + x\nSubtract 19 from both sides:\nx = -17\nAgain, negative number. That can't be right. Maybe the problem is supposed to say that Ed has 19 more marbles than Doug now, not before? Let me re-read the problem.\n\n\"Ed had 2 more marbles than Doug. Doug lost some of his marbles at the playground. Now Ed has 19 more marbles than doug. How many marbles did Doug lose?\"\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem meant that after Doug lost some marbles, Ed has 19 more than Doug. So, Ed's current marbles = Doug's current marbles + 19. Let's try that.\n\nLet's let Doug's current marbles be D. Then Ed's current marbles are D + 19. Originally, Ed had 2 more than Doug, so Ed's original marbles were D + 2. The difference between Ed's current and original is (D + 19) - (D + 2) = 17. So the number of marbles Doug lost is 17. Wait, that makes sense. So the answer is 17. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal: Doug has D, Ed has D + 2.\nAfter losing x marbles, Doug has D - x. Ed has D + 2 - x.\nNow, Ed has 19 more than Doug: D + 2 - x = (D - x) + 19\nSimplify: D + 2 - x = D - x + 19\nSubtract D - x from both sides: 2 - x = 19\nAdd x to both sides: 2 = 19 + x\nSubtract 19 from both sides: x = -17. No, that's not possible. Wait, that can't be right. This suggests that the problem is impossible, but perhaps there's a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me read it again. \"Ed had 2 more marbles than Doug. Doug lost some of his marbles at the playground. Now Ed has 19 more marbles than doug. How many marbles did Doug lose?\"\n\nAh, maybe the problem meant that after losing some marbles, Ed has 19 more than Doug. So, Ed's current marbles = Doug's current marbles + 19. Then, Ed originally had D + 2, and now he has (D + 2) - x = D + 19. So solving for x: D + 2 - x = D + 19 \u2192 2 - x = 19 \u2192 -x = 17 \u2192 x = -17. Still negative. That can't be right. So perhaps the problem is correct, and the answer is -17, which is impossible. Therefore, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem. But given the problem as stated, the answer is -17, but since the number of marbles can't be negative, perhaps the problem is intended to be different. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe the problem says that Ed has 19 fewer marbles than Doug now. Then, it would be D - (D + 2) = -2, which is impossible. Hmm, maybe the problem is correct. Let me re-express the equation again.\n\nLet's define:\n\nOriginal marbles: Ed = D + 2, Doug = D.\n\nNow, Ed has 19 more than Doug: D + 2 - x = D + 19.\n\nSimplify: 2 - x = 19 \u2192 -x = 17 \u2192 x = -17. So Doug lost 17 marbles. So the answer is 17. But that seems counterintuitive. Wait, if Doug loses 17 marbles, then he has D - 17 marbles, and Ed has D + 2 - 17 = D -15. Then, Ed has 19 more than Doug: D -15 = (D -17) +19 \u2192 D -15 = D +2 \u2192 2 =15. That's impossible. So maybe the problem is correct, and the answer is 17.

The problem says Ed had 2 more marbles than Doug. Then, Doug lost some marbles at the playground, and now Ed has 19 more marbles than Doug. We need to find out how many marbles Doug lost.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. Let's start by defining the variables. Let's say Doug originally had \\( D \\) marbles. Then Ed had \\( D + 2 \\) marbles, because Ed had 2 more than Doug initially.\n\nNow, Doug lost some marbles. Let's call the number of marbles he lost \\( x \\). So after losing \\( x \\) marbles, Doug has \\( D - x \\) marbles left. \n\nAt the same time, Ed's number of marbles didn't change. Wait, the problem says Ed has 19 more marbles than Doug now. So Ed's current number of marbles is \\( D + 2 \\) (which is the same as before, since he didn't lose any marbles). And Doug's current number is \\( D - x \\). According to the problem, Ed has 19 more than Doug now. So the equation should be:\n\n\\[ D + 2 = (D - x) + 19 \\]\n\nLet me write that down. Yes, that's correct. Let's simplify this equation.

Let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nOriginal: Doug has \\( D \\), Ed has \\( D + 2 \\). After losing \\( x \\) marbles, Doug has \\( D - x \\). Ed's marbles remain \\( D + 2 \\). The problem says Ed has 19 more than Doug now. So:\n\n\\[ D + 2 = (D - x) + 19 \\]\n\nSimplify left side: \\( D + 2 \\)\n\nSimplify right side: \\( D - x + 19 \\)\n\nSo equation: \\( D + 2 = D - x + 19 \\)\n\nSubtract \\( D \\) from both sides: \\( 2 = -x + 19 \\)\n\nSubtract 19 from both sides: \\( 2 - 19 = -x \\) \u2192 \\( -17 = -x \\) \u2192 \\( x = 17 \\)\n\nYes, that seems right. So Doug lost 17 marbles. Let me verify with an example. Suppose Doug originally had 10 marbles. Then Ed had 12. If Doug loses 17 marbles, he has 10 - 17 = -7 marbles, which isn't possible. Wait, that can't be right. Oh, wait, the problem must be set up differently. Let me re-read the problem.\n\n\"Ed had 2 more marbles than Doug. Doug lost some of his marbles at the playground. Now Ed has 19 more marbles than doug. How many marbles did Doug lose?\"\n\nOh, wait, maybe I made a mistake in the setup. Let me think again. The problem says Ed had 2 more than Doug initially. So Ed = Doug + 2. Then, after Doug loses some marbles, Ed has 19 more than Doug. So Ed's current number is Doug's current number + 19. \n\nSo let's let Doug's current marbles be \\( D \\). Then Ed's current marbles are \\( D + 19 \\). But Ed's original number was \\( D + 2 \\). So the change in Ed's marbles is \\( (D + 19) - (D + 2) = 17 \\). Wait, that's not right. Wait, no. Let me re-express this.\n\nLet me define variables properly. Let \\( D \\) be the number of marbles Doug has now. Then Ed has \\( D + 2 \\) marbles now (since Ed had 2 more than Doug initially, and that hasn't changed). The problem says now Ed has 19 more marbles than Doug. So:\n\n\\[ D + 2 = D + 19 \\]\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says \"Ed has 19 more marbles than Doug\". So Ed's current marbles = Doug's current marbles + 19. So:\n\n\\[ D + 2 = D + 19 \\]\n\nWait, that would imply 2 = 19, which is impossible. That can't be. So there must be a different approach.

Then Ed's original marbles are \\( D + 2 \\).\n\nAfter Doug loses some marbles, let's say he loses \\( x \\) marbles. So Doug's current marbles are \\( D - x \\). Ed's marbles remain \\( D + 2 \\). According to the problem, Ed has 19 more marbles than Doug now. So:\n\n\\[ D + 2 = (D - x) + 19 \\]\n\nSimplify this equation:\n\n\\[ D + 2 = D - x + 19 \\]\n\nSubtract \\( D \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[ 2 = -x + 19 \\]\n\nSubtract 19 from both sides:\n\n\\[ 2 - 19 = -x \\]\n\n\\[ -17 = -x \\]\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n\\[ x = 17 \\]\n\nSo Doug lost 17 marbles. Let me check this again. If Doug originally had 10 marbles, then Ed had 12. If Doug loses 17 marbles, he has -7 marbles, which is impossible. So that can't be. Wait, the problem says \"lost some of his marbles\", so he can't have a negative number. Therefore, there's a mistake in my approach. \n\nWait, maybe I need to set up the equation differently. Let's think again. Let's let Doug's current number of marbles be \\( D \\). Then Ed's current number is \\( D + 2 + x \\) (since Ed didn't lose any marbles, he still has 2 more than Doug). According to the problem, Ed has 19 more than Doug now. So:\n\n\\[ D + 2 + x = D + 19 \\]\n\nSimplify this equation:\n\n\\[ D + 2 + x = D + 19 \\]\n\nSubtract \\( D \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[ 2 + x = 19 \\]\n\nSubtract 2 from both sides:\n\n\\[ x = 17 \\]\n\nYes, that's the same result. So the answer is 17. So Doug lost 17 marbles. Let me verify with the original numbers. If Doug originally had 10 marbles, then Ed had 12. If Doug loses 17 marbles, he has -7, which is impossible.

Maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the problem again. Oh, wait, maybe it's \"13 fewer peaches\" meaning Jake has 13 fewer peaches than Steven. So, peaches: Jake = Steven's peaches - 13. So 9 - 13 = -4. No, that can't be. If you have fewer peaches, you can't have a negative number. So perhaps the problem is phrased differently. Wait, maybe it's \"13 fewer than Steven's peaches.\" So Jake's peaches = Steven's peaches - 13. So 9 - 13 = -4. That's not possible. So maybe the problem is saying that Jake has 13 fewer peaches than Steven. So Jake has 9 - 13 = -4 peaches. Which isn't possible. That can't be. So maybe there's a mistake in the problem. But the problem must be correct, so perhaps I'm missing something. Let me read again.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"Jake has 13 fewer peaches and 3 more apples than Steven.\" So, peaches: Jake = Steven's peaches - 13. Apples: Jake = Steven's apples + 3. So, peaches: Jake = 9 - 13 = -4. Apples: Jake = 8 + 3 = 11. So Jake has -4 peaches and 11 apples. But you can't have negative peaches. That's impossible. So maybe there's a mistake in the problem. But assuming the problem is correct as given, then the answer would be 11 apples. Even though Jake can't have negative peaches, the problem might be expecting us to ignore that part and focus on apples. Because the question asks how many apples Jake has, which is 11. So maybe the answer is 11. Let me check again.\n\nSteven has 9 peaches and 8 apples. Jake has 13 fewer peaches: 9 - 13 = -4. Apples: 8 + 3 = 11. So yes, Jake has 11 apples. Even though the peaches are impossible, the question only asks for apples. So the answer is 11.\n</LONG_COT>\n<ANSWER>\n11\n</ANSWER>", "answer": "11", "is_correct": true, "token_count": 885, "format": "LONG_COT"}, "inst_direct": {"response": "<ANSWER>\n11\n</ANSWER>", "answer": "11", "is_correct": true, "token_count": 11}, "inst_cot": {"response": "<COT>\nSteven has 9 peaches.\nJake has 13 fewer peaches than Steven.\nJake has 9 - 13 = -4 peaches.\nSteven has 8 apples.\nJake has 3 more apples than Steven.\nJake has 8 + 3 = 11 apples.\nThe answer is 11\n</COT>\n<ANSWER>\n11\n</ANSWER>", "answer": "11", "is_correct": true, "token_count": 85}, "inst_code": {"response": "<CODE>\ndef calculate_apples_jake_has():\n    # Number of peaches and apples Steven has\n    steven_peaches = 9\n    steven_apples = 8\n\n    # Calculate the number of peaches and apples Jake has\n    # Jake has 13 fewer peaches than Steven\n    jake_peaches = steven_peaches - 13\n    # Jake has 3 more apples than Steven\n    jake_apples = steven_apples + 3\n\n    return {\n        'steven_peaches': steven_peaches,\n        'steven_apples': steven_apples,\n        'jake_peaches': jake_peaches,\n        'answer': jake_apples\n    }\n\n>>> calculate_apples_jake_has()\n\noutput = {\n    'steven_peaches': 9,\n    'steven_apples': 8,\n    'jake_peaches': -4,\n    'answer': 11\n}\n</CODE>\n<ANSWER>\n11\n</ANSWER>", "answer": "11", "is_correct": true, "token_count": 220}, "inst_long_cot": {"response": "<LONG_COT>\nOkay, let's see. The problem says that Jake has 13 fewer peaches and 3 more apples than Steven. Steven has 9 peaches and 8 apples. We need to find out how many apples Jake has.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. First, Steven's peaches and apples are given. Jake has 13 fewer peaches than Steven. So if Steven has 9 peaches, then Jake has 9 - 13 peaches. Wait, 9 minus 13 is -4. But peaches can't be negative. Did I do that right? Let me check again. The problem says \"13 fewer peaches,\" which means Jake's peaches are Steven's peaches minus 13. So 9 - 13 = -4. That doesn't make sense. Maybe I misread the sentence. Let me read it again.\n\n\"Jake has 13 fewer peaches and 3 more apples than Steven.\" Oh, wait, maybe it's \"13 fewer peaches\" and \"3 more apples.\" So peaches: Steven has 9, Jake has 9 - 13 = -4. That can't be right. So maybe the problem is phrased differently. Let me think again. Oh, perhaps it's \"13 fewer peaches\" meaning Jake has 13 fewer peaches than Steven, so Jake's peaches are 9 - 13 = -4, which is impossible. That can't be. So maybe I need to interpret it as \"Jake has 13 fewer peaches than Steven.\" So peaches: Jake = Steven - 13. Which is 9 - 13 = -4. That's not possible. So maybe the problem is saying that Jake has 13 fewer peaches than Steven, but that can't be. So maybe there's a mistake in the problem. Wait, maybe it's \"3 more apples\" than Steven. So apples: Jake = Steven + 3. So 8 + 3 = 11. So Jake has 11 apples. Let me check that again.\n\nSteven has 8 apples. Jake has 3 more than Steven. So 8 + 3 = 11. That makes sense. So the answer is 11. Let me verify all the numbers. Peaches: Steven has 9, Jake has 9 - 13 = -4, which is impossible. So that must be a mistake. The problem must have a different interpretation. Maybe it's \"13 fewer peaches\" meaning Jake's peaches are Steven's peaches minus 13, which is 9 - 13 = -4, which is not possible. So perhaps the problem intended to say \"3 more apples\" than Steven. Yes, that seems correct. So the answer is 11.\n</LONG_COT>\n<ANSWER>\n11\n</ANSWER>", "answer": "11", "is_correct": true, "token_count": 620}}
